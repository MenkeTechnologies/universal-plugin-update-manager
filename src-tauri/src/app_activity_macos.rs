//! Disable macOS App Nap for the host process.
//!
//! After ~hours of user idle, macOS throttles CPU, coalesces timers, and (under memory
//! pressure) compresses or swaps the process's pages. Coming back to play the next sample
//! then takes seconds while the OS un-throttles and decompresses — visible as UI lag,
//! waveform slow to draw, and audio slow to start. Subsequent playbacks are fast because
//! everything is hot again. Classic App Nap symptom.
//!
//! Music apps (Logic, Music.app, Spotify, Audio Hijack) prevent this by holding an
//! `NSProcessInfo.beginActivityWithOptions:reason:` token for their lifetime. We do the
//! same — `NSActivityUserInitiatedAllowingIdleSystemSleep` keeps the host unthrottled
//! while still letting the laptop sleep when the user walks away (we don't want to be a
//! battery hog).
//!
//! Note: this only covers the host. The `audio-engine` JUCE subprocess is independent;
//! it stays hot via the periodic keep-alive ping fired from `lib.rs`'s HEALTH sampler.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! Earlier versions deferred `beginActivity` onto a worker thread that slept 500 ms. That
//! was unsafe: a foreign ObjC exception thrown by the call would unwind through the Rust
//! frame and trip `panic_cannot_unwind` (Rust cannot catch foreign exceptions across an
//! extern "C" boundary), aborting the host before the WebView could render — a
//! white-screen launch crash that varied by 5–15 s depending on how long
//! `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` was still running. The fix is to call from
//! `RunEvent::Ready` instead, which fires on the main thread *after* `did_finish_launching`
//! has returned, inside the normal Tauri runloop where there is no extern "C" boundary
//! and a panic propagates up the hook and is logged.
