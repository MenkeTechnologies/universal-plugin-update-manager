# audio-engine

AudioEngine binary for **AUDIO_HAXOR**: **JUCE 8** (`AudioDeviceManager`, `AudioTransportSource`, `AudioFormatReader`) for **input/output** device discovery, **library file playback** with 3-band EQ / gain / pan, **VST3** + **AU** (macOS) **plugin scanning** via `KnownPluginList` + `PluginDirectoryScanner`, **native plug-in editor windows** (`DocumentWindow` + `AudioProcessorEditor`), and a **persistent** stdin line protocol (one JSON request in → one JSON line out). A **stdin reader thread** runs `Engine::dispatch` (most commands take `Impl::mutex` on that thread). **Main** is the JUCE **message thread**: it loops `MessageManager::runDispatchLoopUntil` until stdin closes so async plugin creation and **UI** (`callFunctionOnMessageThread` for insert editors, etc.) can run.

## License (JUCE)

JUCE is distributed under the **GPLv3** (or a **commercial** license from Raw Material Software). Building and distributing this AudioEngine **without** a JUCE commercial license generally implies **GPL obligations** for the combined work. Confirm your licensing model before shipping binaries.

## Protocol

### JSON responses (`okObj()`)

**Never** call `okObj().getDynamicObject()` on the temporary `var` — the `var` is destroyed at the end of the full-expression, so the `DynamicObject*` dangles. Keep a named `juce::var out = okObj();`, mutate `out.getDynamicObject()`, and `return out`.

### Crash diagnostics

The AudioEngine installs **POSIX signal handlers** (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGABRT) and **`std::terminate`**: on fatal signals it writes **`ENGINE [fatal signal …]`** plus a **`backtrace_symbols_fd`** stack to **stderr** and, when **`AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG`** or **`AUDIO_HAXOR_APP_LOG`** is set, appends the same to that file (raw lines, not the usual `[timestamp] ENGINE:` prefix; **prefer `AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG`** so crash dumps land next to normal engine lines). **SIGPIPE is ignored** so a closed stdout/pipe does not kill the process silently before the next write fails. After a crash, the host’s **`audio-engine IPC error`** line often includes a **stderr tail** with this text. For symbol names, link with **`-rdynamic`** on Linux if stacks are opaque.

The Tauri host sets **`AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG`** to the absolute path of **`engine.log`** in the app data directory (same folder as **`audio_haxor.db`** — on macOS typically **`~/Library/Application Support/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor/`**, matching `tauri.conf.json` **`identifier`**; timestamped **`ENGINE:`** lines). When the file exceeds **5MB**, it is renamed to **`engine.log.1`** (replacing any previous backup). If rename fails, the file is **deleted or truncated** so it cannot grow unbounded. Rotation runs on startup and before each append (same cap as the host’s **`app.log`**). It also sets **`AUDIO_HAXOR_APP_LOG`** to **`app.log`** for backward compatibility; **`AppLog`** prefers **`AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG`** when both are set. **`AUDIO_HAXOR_PARENT_PID`** is the host’s process ID.

**Extra tracing:** set **`AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG_STDERR`** to any non-empty value so every **`engine.log`** line is **also** written to **stderr** (useful for piped/CLI runs where you did not set a log file path). Lifecycle messages include **stdin reader thread started**, **entering message pump loop (message thread)**, **AudioDeviceManager** first-init bracketing, **parent watchdog: armed**, and **parent watchdog:** exit reason when the host PID disappears. A background thread in **`ParentWatchdog.cpp`** polls every 2s: if that PID is gone (normal exit, crash, or **force quit** / SIGKILL where Rust teardown never runs), the AudioEngine calls **`std::_Exit(0)`** so orphaned **`audio-engine`** processes do not keep running. The AudioEngine appends lines as **`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] ENGINE: …`** (UTC timestamp; same bracket style as the host’s `write_app_log`). Typical messages: startup, **`stdin` parse failure**, one line per request with the command name (for example **`cmd list_output_devices`**) except **`ping`**, **`playback_status`**, and **`playback_seek`** (polling / frequent seeks), **`error:`** lines for every JSON error response from **`dispatch`** (unknown commands, validation failures, device errors, preview failures, etc.) and for fatal plugin-scan worker exceptions, and exit when stdin closes. For a **standalone** binary (no env var), file logging is a no-op and the parent watchdog is inactive.

Each line is a JSON object with at least `cmd`. Optional fields include `device_id`, `tone` (bool, output only), `buffer_frames` (positive `u32`, **capped at 8192**), **`sample_rate_hz`** (positive integer, optional on **`start_output_stream`** / **`start_input_stream`**), and **`start_playback`** (bool, output only): when `true` after **`playback_load`**, output is driven by **JUCE** transport on the selected device (not the test-tone path). Omit **`sample_rate_hz`** to let the driver pick a rate (or, for playback without an explicit rate, the file’s sample rate is used when **`start_playback`** is set).

### Library playback (JUCE + DSP)

**`playback_load`** opens the path with **`AudioFormatManager`** (`registerBasicFormats`). Duration and source sample rate come from the reader. The AudioEngine handles **`playback_load`** before **`AudioDeviceManager::initialise`** so opening a file does not block on CoreAudio first — device setup runs when **`start_output_stream`** (or any other audio-device command) runs. **`start_output_stream`** with **`start_playback: true`** wires **`AudioTransportSource`** → **`AudioSourcePlayer`** → **`AudioDeviceManager`** output callback. DSP (EQ / gain / pan) runs in **`DspStereoFileSource`**, then **optional VST3 / AU inserts** (see **`playback_set_inserts`**), before audio reaches the device. **Reverse playback** uses a sample-wise path — **inserts are skipped** in that mode.

| Command | Fields | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `playback_load` | `path` (absolute) | Open file; store session; does **not** open output. |
| `start_output_stream` | `start_playback: true`, `device_id`, optional `buffer_frames`, optional `sample_rate_hz` | After **`playback_load`**, start transport on the device. |
| `playback_pause` | `paused` (bool) | Pause / resume transport. |
| `playback_seek` | `position_sec` | Seek (seconds on the forward timeline). |
| `playback_set_dsp` | `gain`, `pan`, `eq_low_db`, `eq_mid_db`, `eq_high_db` | Update DSP parameters. |
| `playback_set_speed` | `speed` (float, clamped 0.25–2.0) | **`ResamplingAudioSource`** on the forward file path (tape-style: pitch follows speed). **Reverse** playback ignores resampling (response may include a **note**). |
| `playback_set_reverse` | `reverse` (bool) | When `true`, full-decode-to-RAM reverse path for the next playback. |
| `playback_status` | — | Position, duration, peak, pause, EOF, reverse, sample rates. When output is running, also **`spectrum`**: 1024 **uint8** magnitudes (0–255) for FFT bins 1…1024 of a Hann-windowed real FFT (order 11 → size 2048), normalized per frame to the max bin; **`spectrum_fft_size`**, **`spectrum_bins`** (1024), **`spectrum_sr_hz`**. The tap is **mono (L+R)/2** taken **after** DSP and **VST/AU inserts** on the forward path (reverse playback has no inserts). |
| `playback_stop` | — | Stop transport and clear session. |
| `playback_set_inserts` | `paths` (JSON array, max 32, empty clears): each entry is either an on-disk **`.vst3` bundle** / **`.component`**, or the same **`fileOrIdentifier`** string the UI got from **`plugin_chain`** **`plugins`** (e.g. **`AudioUnit:…`** — not a filesystem path). **Resolution:** **`fileOrIdentifier` must match an entry in the scan cache** (no synchronous disk probe — avoids hangs on WaveShell / heavy bundles). | Load **VST3** / **AU** (macOS) effect instances in order. **Requires** `stop_output_stream` first (no hot-swap while the device is open). Closes any open insert editor windows. |
| `playback_open_insert_editor` | `slot` (int, 0-based index into the **loaded** insert chain) | Opens a **native** editor for that instance (`createEditorIfNeeded`). **Marshalled onto the JUCE message thread** (`callFunctionOnMessageThread`); stdin IPC thread must not build `DocumentWindow` / plugin UI. Fails with `plugin has no editor` if the plug-in has no UI. |
| `playback_close_insert_editor` | `slot` (int) | Closes the hosted editor window for that chain index, if open. **Also runs on the message thread** so window teardown matches JUCE rules. |

`stop_output_stream` tears down the output device graph and clears playback as needed.

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ping` | Version + host id |
| `waveform_preview` | **`path`** (absolute), optional **`width_px`** (32–8192, default 800), **`start_sec`**, **`duration_sec`** (max 300 s) — decodes a segment and returns **`peaks`**: array of `{ "min", "max" }` per column (mono mix). No device init. Handled **before** `Engine::Impl::mutex`: work runs on a **`std::async` thread** and takes a dedicated **`previewMutex`** so long decodes do not block other engine commands behind the main lock. |
| `spectrogram_preview` | **`path`**, optional **`width_px`** / **`height_px`** (16–512, defaults 256×128), **`fft_order`** (8–15 → FFT size 256…32768), **`start_sec`**, **`duration_sec`** (max 120 s) — STFT magnitudes in dB. Response **`rows`**: outer = frequency (low→high), inner = time columns; **`db_min`** / **`db_max`** (–100…0). Same **`std::async`** + **`previewMutex`** pattern as **`waveform_preview`**. |
| `engine_state` | Aggregated stream snapshot |
| `list_output_devices` / `list_input_devices` | Enumerate devices (uses the active JUCE device type; falls back across types if the current type lists nothing) |
| `list_audio_device_types` | Lists JUCE driver types: `types` is a **JSON array of strings** (driver names); `current` is the active type |
| `set_audio_device_type` | `type` (string) — switches **AudioDeviceManager** driver; **stops** active output/input streams |
| `get_output_device_info` / `get_input_device_info` | Default config + `buffer_size` + `sample_rates` + `buffer_sizes` + `audio_device_type` |
| `set_output_device` / `set_input_device` | Validate `device_id` |
| `start_output_stream` / `stop_output_stream` | Output; optional tone or file playback |
| `start_input_stream` / `stop_input_stream` | Input; peak meter |
| `output_stream_status` / `input_stream_status` | Status lines |
| `set_output_tone` | 440 Hz sine when F32 output + not in file playback mode |
| `plugin_chain` | Scanned plugin list + **`insert_paths`** / **`slots`**. First request starts a **background** VST3/AU directory scan; responses use **`phase`: `"scanning"`** until done, then **`phase`: `"juce"`** with **`plugins`**. While **`phase` is `"scanning"`**, JSON includes **`scan_done`**, **`scan_total`** (candidate file counts), **`scan_skipped`** (modules skipped because the cached listing is up to date), **`scan_cache_loaded`** (whether `known-plugin-list.xml` was read), **`scan_current_format`** (`VST3` / `AU`), **`scan_current_name`** (plug-in currently being scanned). For **which bundle/path is being scanned** (and a monotonic **`scan_seq`** aligned with **`scan_done` + 1** for the next module), see **`engine.log`**: lines **`plugin scan: START …`** include **`file="…"`** (AU identifier or `.vst3` path), **`name="…"`**, **`format_pos`** within the format, and **`cache_listing_up_to_date`**. **Each module is scanned in a child `audio-engine` process** (`--plugin-scan-one`): the parent persists the current cache, spawns the child, waits up to **`AUDIO_HAXOR_PLUGIN_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SEC`** (default **120**, clamped **5–3600** seconds), then **kills** the child on timeout — **`plugin scan: TIMEOUT_KILL`** / **`TIMEOUT_SKIP`** — and blacklists that identifier (same **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`** path as other skips). **`plugin scan: OOP_FAIL_SKIP`** / **`OOP_START_FAIL_SKIP`** cover child failures or failure to spawn. Successful children write merged **`KnownPluginList`** XML back for the parent to load. **`plugin scan: FAIL_SKIP …`** (legacy wording in older logs) covered **`scanNextFile`** throws in the **in-process** scanner; the subprocess path treats non-zero child exit like a skip. You can **pre-populate** **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`** to skip a known-bad AU/VST without loading it. The engine also **always excludes** several Apple system AU identifiers that **hang indefinitely** inside JUCE’s `scanNextFile` (no throw, so no throw-based skip): **AUVectorPanner** (`AudioUnit:Panners/aupn,vbas,appl`), **AUMixer** (`AudioUnit:Mixers/mixr,aumx,appl`), **AUMatrixMixer** (`…/mixr,mxmx,appl`), **AUMultiChannelMixer** (`…/mixr,mcmx,appl`), **AUSpatialMixer** (`…,spmx,appl` — any AU identifier whose subtype is **`spmx`** and manufacturer **`appl`** is skipped, not only `AudioUnit:Mixers/mixr,spmx,appl`). Add more via **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`** or **`AUDIO_HAXOR_PLUGIN_SCAN_SKIP`** using the exact **`file="…"`** string from **`plugin scan: START`** in **`engine.log`**. Set **`AUDIO_HAXOR_PLUGIN_SCAN_SKIP`** to a comma-separated list of **additional** full identifiers to skip without editing the file. **`plugin scan: SKIP_LIST …`** in **`engine.log`** is logged when an identifier is removed by the merged skip list (file + built-ins + env). **`plugin scan: worker starting`** and **`plugin scan: VST3 phase complete; starting AU`** bracket phases on macOS. **`KnownPluginList`** is persisted to **`known-plugin-list.xml`** in the same app-data folder as the dead-man’s-pedal file so restarts reuse unchanged entries (see **Plugin scan cache files** below — incremental writes during the worker; JUCE **`BLACKLISTED`** entries are serialized **after** plugin descriptions). JUCE **dead-man's-pedal** file **`plugin-scan-dead-mans-pedal.txt`** lives in **`appDataDirectoryForAudioEngine()`**: the **parent directory of `engine.log`** when the host sets **`AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG`** (same as Tauri app data); if neither log env var is set (standalone AudioEngine), **`userApplicationDataDirectory/MenkeTechnologies/audio-haxor`**. It defers crashy modules to the end on later runs. **Native crashes** in the **child** process lose that module’s result but **do not** kill the long-lived parent AudioEngine; the **last `plugin scan: START` line** before a crash identifies the module — copy **`file=`** into **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`** if it keeps crashing. **Playback:** while **file output is running** (`outputRunning` + `playbackMode`), the scan worker **sleeps 2ms** after each module so the parent’s audio callback is less likely to starve (child processes carry most **`scanNextFile`** CPU load). |

## Plugin scan cache files

- **`known-plugin-list.xml`** — Same directory as **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`**, **`plugin-scan-dead-mans-pedal.txt`**, and (when the host sets it) the parent of **`engine.log`**: **`appDataDirectoryForAudioEngine()`**. With the Tauri app on macOS that is typically **`~/Library/Application Support/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor/`**. If you run **`audio-engine` standalone** without **`AUDIO_HAXOR_ENGINE_LOG`** / **`AUDIO_HAXOR_APP_LOG`**, the directory is **`~/Library/Application Support/MenkeTechnologies/audio-haxor/`** instead — a **different** folder, so looking only under the bundle id path will not show files from a CLI run.

  **JUCE layout (not truncation):** The root tag is **`KNOWNPLUGINS`**. JUCE **`KnownPluginList::createXml()`** writes **one XML child per successfully known plugin** (`PluginDescription`), **then** appends **`<BLACKLISTED id="…"/>`** for identifiers that failed or were blacklisted during scan. So **all `BLACKLISTED` nodes come after** the plugin entries — that section is **not** “plugins omitted after the first N.” If you see only a small number of plugin elements before a long **`BLACKLISTED`** run, **`KnownPluginList`** really has that many **successful** descriptions and the rest are failures or skips — use **`plugin scan: FAIL_SKIP`** / **`START`** in **`engine.log`** and **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`**. This cache is **separate** from the main app’s SQLite plugin inventory.

  **Persistence:** The engine **re-saves after each scanned module** (and on per-module failure paths) so a crash mid-scan still leaves a partial cache. **Disk/XML write errors** log **`known-plugin-list.xml write failed (continuing)`** and do **not** abort the scan (no need to restart the engine to continue past a bad module). **VST3** and **AU** phases are isolated: an unexpected error in one phase is logged and the other phase still runs. **`plugin_chain`** reaches **`phase: "juce"`** with whatever plugins were successfully registered; **`phase: failed`** is reserved for a future fatal IPC path and is **not** used for ordinary per-plugin scan failures.

  **Fast path:** The first **`plugin_chain`** while scan state is **Idle** loads **`known-plugin-list.xml`** when it contains at least one plugin type, returns **`phase: "juce"`** immediately (no background rescan), and populates insert-slot options. Remove or invalidate the XML to force a full scan on the next **Idle** **`plugin_chain`**.

  **`plugin_rescan`:** Cancels any running scan (cooperative flag checked per module), deletes **`known-plugin-list.xml`**, **`plugin-scan-skip.txt`**, and **`plugin-scan-dead-mans-pedal.txt`**, clears the in-memory cache, and resets scan state to **Idle**. The next **`plugin_chain`** triggers a full fresh scan. The UI exposes this as **"Wipe cache & rescan"**. Accepts an optional **`timeout_sec`** field (5–3600) to update the per-plugin scan timeout for the current engine process (sets `AUDIO_HAXOR_PLUGIN_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SEC` in-process). The UI exposes this as a number input next to the rescan button; the value is persisted in preferences as **`pluginScanTimeoutSec`** and also passed as an env var to the engine at spawn time.

## Automated tests (IPC)

From the repository root, after a **Debug** or **Release** build (`node scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs`):

```bash
pnpm run test:audio-engine
# or: node scripts/run-audio-engine-tests.mjs
```

These tests spawn the binary and assert **stdin/stdout JSON** (`ping`, bad JSON handling including **multiple** bad lines, **`cmd`** case folding, **blank stdin lines** (no matching stdout line), **`playback_load`** / **`waveform_preview`** / **`spectrogram_preview`** path validation including **directories** and **empty on-disk** files that are not a supported format — **no** `list_*_devices` / `plugin_chain`, which can block in piped shells). Override the binary path with **`AUDIO_ENGINE_TEST_BIN`**. On **Linux** without a display, run under **`xvfb-run -a`** (as in CI).

## Build

**Prerequisites:** **CMake** ≥ 3.22, **Ninja**, and a C++20 toolchain. Platform libs (e.g. **ALSA** on Linux) must match your JUCE audio backend expectations.

From the **repository root**:

```bash
# Debug (matches pnpm tauri dev — beforeDevCommand)
node scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs

# Release (matches prepare AudioEngine)
AUDIO_ENGINE_BUILD_TYPE=release node scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs
```

Artifacts land at **`target/debug/audio-engine`** or **`target/release/audio-engine`** (same layout as the old Cargo output). **Release** bundles use `scripts/prepare-audio-engine-audioengine.mjs` → `src-tauri/binaries/audio-engine-<triple>` for Tauri `externalBin`.

### Linux (typical)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build build-essential \
  libasound2-dev libfreetype6-dev libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

### Device types (`list_audio_device_types`)

Use **`createAudioDeviceTypes()`** into a **local** `OwnedArray` — do **not** call **`getAvailableDeviceTypes()`** for this IPC. The latter runs **`scanDevicesIfNeeded()`** on the manager’s internal list; with **two** `AudioDeviceManager` instances (output + input) in the same process, that path can destabilize or crash the AudioEngine on some platforms (macOS), which shows up in the host as **`AudioEngine closed stdout`** after a respawn.

The **`types`** field is a **JSON array of strings** (one name per driver). Older builds used an array of `{ "type": "…" }` objects; the UI accepts both.

## Manual stdin/stdout (shell)

The AudioEngine speaks **one JSON object per line** on stdin and prints **one JSON line** per response on stdout (see `src/Main.cpp`).

**Bundled macOS app:** The AudioEngine lives under **`Contents/MacOS/`**. Tauri’s [external-binary](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/sidecar/) naming is **`audio-engine-<rustc-host-tuple>`** in `src-tauri/binaries/` at build time; your shipped `.app` may expose that suffixed name, a plain **`audio-engine`**, or both — **`ls "/Applications/AUDIO_HAXOR.app/Contents/MacOS"`** shows what you actually have.

```bash
# If you have the plain name:
AE="/Applications/AUDIO_HAXOR.app/Contents/MacOS/audio-engine"
# If you only have the triple-suffixed binary:
# AE="/Applications/AUDIO_HAXOR.app/Contents/MacOS/audio-engine-$(rustc --print host-tuple)"

printf '%s\n' '{"cmd":"ping"}' | "$AE"
printf '%s\n' '{"cmd":"plugin_chain"}' | "$AE"
```

Any non-JSON line (e.g. testing the pipe with random text) gets a single **`{"ok":false,"error":"bad JSON"}`** response — that confirms stdin/stdout wiring; use **`printf '%s\n' …`** for real commands so `{` / `"` are not eaten by the shell (avoid **`echo …`** with nested quotes unless you are sure of your shell’s rules).

**Dev build (repo):** after `node scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs`, use the unsuffixed binary:

```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"cmd":"ping"}' | ./target/debug/audio-engine
```

Use **`printf '%s\n' …`** instead of **`echo …`** so quotes and newlines are predictable.

**Process sits with no stdout when piping (even `ping`):** Older builds called **`AudioDeviceManager::initialise`** for output + input inside **`Engine`** construction, **before** the stdin thread ran (that could block in CoreAudio). **Also**, **`MessageManager::callAsync`** + blocking on **`fut.get()`** from the stdin thread was unsafe on **macOS** until **`[NSApp run]`** is pumping. Current builds **defer** device-manager init until the **first non-`ping`** command and run **`Engine::dispatch` on the stdin thread** for every line (no `callAsync` / futures for IPC), so **`ping`**, typos like **`dping`**, and **`bad JSON`** all return a line without waiting on the AppKit loop for delivery.

**Hangs on `list_audio_device_types` / `list_*_devices` when piping from Terminal:** Those commands call JUCE **`AudioDeviceManager::createAudioDeviceTypes`** / enumeration, which uses **CoreAudio** on macOS. With **stdin from a pipe** the process is not a normal foreground GUI session; CoreAudio can **block for a long time or indefinitely** (waiting on HAL / session / permissions). Prefer exercising device IPC from the **host app** (Audio Engine tab) or run tests against **`ping`** / non-audio commands in the shell. **`plugin_chain`** can also take a long time on first call while JUCE scans plug-ins.

**Override path (host or manual testing):** set **`AUDIO_HAXOR_AUDIO_ENGINE`** to an absolute path to any built `audio-engine` binary (see “Stale AudioEngine” below).

## Stale AudioEngine / `unknown cmd`

The app keeps **one** long-lived `audio-engine` child. After rebuilding, an old process can still answer stdin until replaced. The Tauri host respawns when the resolved binary’s **size/mtime** changes. If IPC looks wrong, quit the app or set **`AUDIO_HAXOR_AUDIO_ENGINE`** to an absolute path to a fresh `target/debug/audio-engine` or `target/release/audio-engine`.

## Host app (WEB UI)

`frontend/js/audio-engine.js` drives the Audio Engine tab and coordinates **`playback_*`** with the floating player. Behavior matches the root **`README.md`** Audio Engine / dev-vs-build sections (IPC guards, `engine_state` resync, input peak polling, etc.). The **panel refresh** completes after device lists and caps; **VST3/AU directory scan** (`plugin_chain` → `phase: scanning`) continues in the **background** so the tab does not stay on “loading” for the full scan duration. While scanning, the UI **polls** `plugin_chain` and refreshes the Audio Engine plug-in progress line plus a **single** slide-in toast (updated in place, not stacked) — **`scan_done` / current plug-in name stay flat while JUCE blocks inside one slow module**, so the client shows **elapsed seconds** on that step. After **`AE_PLUGIN_SCAN_STUCK_HINT_SEC`** seconds on the same step (see `frontend/js/audio-engine.js`) it also appends **`ui.ae.plugins_scan_stuck_hint`**. **Hang vs crash:** the worker process stays alive while a **child** is stuck in `scanNextFile`; the parent eventually **kills** that child after **`AUDIO_HAXOR_PLUGIN_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SEC`** (see **`TIMEOUT_KILL`** / **`TIMEOUT_SKIP`** in **`engine.log`**). If **`plugin_chain`** still returns JSON, the main AudioEngine did not exit. The **dead-man’s-pedal** file still helps **crashy** plug-ins on **later** runs. **Restart Audio Engine** is only needed if the parent itself wedged (rare) or you changed the binary.
