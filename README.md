> **// SYSTEM ONLINE -- AUDIO_HAXOR v1.3.0 // by MenkeTechnologies**

A high-voltage **Tauri v2** desktop app that jacks into your system's audio plugin directories, maps every VST2/VST3/AU module it finds, scans audio sample libraries, discovers DAW project files, checks the web for the latest plugin versions, and maintains a full changelog of every scan -- so nothing slips through the cracks. Rust backend with a cyberpunk CRT interface featuring neon glow, scanline overlays, glitch effects, and multiple color schemes.

## // VISUAL INTERFACE //

### `> BOOT SEQUENCE`

![Welcome Screen](screenshots/welcome.png)

*Initial state -- the grid is dark, awaiting your scan command. Last scan auto-loads on startup.*

---

### `> SCANNING AUDIO NODES...`

![Scan Results](screenshots/scan-results.png)

*Plugins stream into the list in real-time as the background worker discovers them. Progress counter and bar show live status. Hit Stop to cancel anytime -- discovered plugins are kept.*

---

### `> UPDATE MATRIX LOADED`

![Update Checker](screenshots/updates.png)

*Checks KVR Audio for the latest version of each plugin. Cards update incrementally with `Update Available` or `Up to Date` badges as results arrive. Yellow `KVR` buttons link directly to the product page. A live status bar shows the current plugin being checked and running tallies.*

---

### `> SCAN HISTORY // DIFF ENGINE`

![History & Diff](screenshots/history.png)

*Every scan is timestamped and archived. Select any two snapshots and the diff engine shows plugins added, removed, or version-changed between them.*

## // CORE MODULES //

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Plugin Scanner** | Detects VST2, VST3, and AU plugins from platform-specific directories on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Shows architecture badges (ARM64, x86_64, Universal) per plugin via direct Mach-O/PE header parsing. Tracks raw byte sizes for accurate disk usage charts. Runs in a background worker thread -- UI stays fully responsive |
| **Audio Scanner** | Discovers audio samples (WAV, FLAC, AIFF, MP3, OGG, etc.) with metadata extraction, file size formatting, and symlink deduplication. Double-click any sample row to start playback (or single-click with the setting enabled). Floating music player with volume, playback speed, seek bar, and loop controls persists across all tabs |
| **DAW Scanner** | Finds DAW project files across 14+ formats -- Ableton (.als), Logic (.logicx), FL Studio (.flp), REAPER (.rpp), Cubase/Nuendo (.cpr/.npr), Pro Tools (.ptx/.ptf), Bitwig (.bwproject), Studio One (.song), Reason (.reason), Audacity (.aup/.aup3), GarageBand (.band), Ardour (.ardour), and dawproject (.dawproject). Double-click any project row to open it directly in its DAW |
| **Plugin Cross-Reference** | Parses Ableton Live (.als) and REAPER (.rpp) project files to extract plugin references (VST2, VST3, AU, CLAP). Shows plugin count badges on DAW rows. Click to see full plugin list. Reverse lookup: right-click any plugin to find which projects use it. Build full index across all supported projects with one click |
| **Version Intel** | Reads version, manufacturer, and website URL from macOS bundle plists (`CFBundleShortVersionString`, `CFBundleIdentifier`, `NSHumanReadableCopyright`) |
| **Update Checker** | Searches [KVR Audio](https://www.kvraudio.com) for each plugin's latest version. Falls back to DuckDuckGo site-restricted KVR search. Runs in a worker thread with rate limiting and streams results back incrementally |
| **KVR Integration** | Yellow KVR button on every plugin links directly to its KVR Audio product page. Double-click any plugin card to open it on KVR. URL is constructed from plugin name + manufacturer with smart slug generation (camelCase splitting, manufacturer lookup table). Falls back to KVR search if the direct URL doesn't exist |
| **KVR Cache** | Resolved KVR data (product URLs, download links, versions) is persisted to `kvr-cache.json`. On restart, cached results are restored instantly and the background resolver resumes from where it left off |
| **Download Button** | Green download button appears on plugins with a confirmed newer version and a KVR download link (platform-specific when available) |
| **Export/Import** | Export all tabs (plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets) to JSON, TOML, CSV, or TSV via native file dialogs. Import from JSON or TOML. Format auto-detected from file extension |
| **Scan History** | Stores up to 50 scan snapshots locally (plugins, audio, and DAW scans merged) with full diff support between any two scans |
| **Batch Updater** | Walk through all outdated plugins one by one with skip/open controls |
| **Manufacturer Link** | Globe button on each plugin opens the manufacturer's website directly (derived from bundle ID). Shows a disabled icon when no website is available |
| **Reveal in Finder** | Folder button opens the plugin's filesystem location. Double-click any preset row to reveal it in Finder. Tooltip shows the full path on hover |
| **Directory Breakdown** | Expandable table showing plugin counts and type breakdown per scanned directory |
| **Stop Control** | Cancel any in-progress scan, update check, or KVR resolution without losing already-discovered results |
| **Auto-Restore** | Last scan results + KVR cache load automatically on app startup -- no need to re-scan or re-check every launch |
| **Unknown Tracking** | Plugins where no version info was found online show "Unknown Latest" badge and are counted separately from "Up to Date" |
| **Color Schemes** | Multiple themes including cyberpunk (default), light mode, and custom schemes with configurable CSS variables |
| **Fuzzy Search** | All search bars default to fuzzy matching (characters match in order, not contiguous). Toggle the `.*` button to switch to regex mode with full pattern support. Available in all tabs |
| **Favorites** | Right-click any plugin, sample, DAW project, or preset to add/remove from favorites. Dedicated Favorites tab shows all starred items with type filter, search, reveal in Finder, and remove actions. Persisted across sessions |
| **Resizable Columns** | Drag column borders to resize. Widths persist across sessions |
| **Floating Player** | Draggable audio player that docks to any corner (drag the handle or toolbar to reposition, snaps to nearest quadrant). Features play/pause, loop, seek bar, volume slider, and playback speed (0.25x-2x). Double-click to expand with recently played history (up to 50 tracks). Dock position persists across sessions. Waveform visualization with cyan-to-magenta gradient and playback cursor |
| **Waveform Preview** | Full-width waveform rendered in the metadata panel when clicking a sample row. Seekable — click anywhere on the waveform to jump to that position. Playback cursor and progress fill update in real-time. Waveform peaks cached in memory for instant re-display |
| **Context Menus** | Right-click context menus on every interactive element -- plugins (KVR, manufacturer, reveal, copy), samples (play, loop, reveal, copy), DAW projects (open in DAW, reveal, copy), presets (reveal, copy), and history entries (view, delete) |
| **Toast Notifications** | Slide-in notifications for actions like opening DAW projects or revealing files in Finder |
| **Disk Usage** | Stacked bar charts showing space breakdown by format/type per tab. Visual representation of storage usage with color-coded legends |
| **Batch Selection** | Checkbox column in all tables for multi-item operations. Select all/deselect, batch favorite, copy paths, export selected as JSON |
| **Duplicate Detection** | Find duplicate files by name+size across plugins, samples, DAW projects, and presets. Modal report grouped by type with full paths |
| **Notes & Tags** | Add notes and comma-separated tags to any item via right-click. Notes persisted in preferences with note indicator icon on tagged items |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Arrow keys/j/k to navigate table rows, Enter to activate, Space to play samples, Home/End to jump. Visual selection highlight |
| **Help Overlay** | Press <kbd>?</kbd> to show a keyboard shortcuts reference overlay covering navigation, actions, search operators, and mouse interactions |
| **Sort Persistence** | Last-used sort column and direction saved per tab, restored on app restart |
| **Multi-Select Filters** | All filter dropdowns support multiple selections (e.g. VST2 + AU, WAV + FLAC). Checkbox-based custom dropdown with "All" toggle |
| **Native Menu Bar** | Full menu bar with File, Edit, Scan, View, Playback, Data, Window, Help menus. All functionality accessible from menus with keyboard accelerators |
| **ETA Timers** | Estimated time remaining on plugin scans and update checks. Elapsed time on audio, DAW, and preset scans |
| **Draggable Tabs** | Drag tabs to reorder. Order persisted across sessions. Reset Tab Order in settings |
| **Cyberpunk Visualizer** | Animated equalizer bars in the floating player with cyan-to-magenta gradient. Bars bounce when playing, freeze on pause. Border glow pulse effect |
| **PDF Export** | Export any tab to PDF (A4 landscape, Helvetica, auto-paginated, header with item count and timestamp) |
| **TOML Export/Import** | Export/import all tabs in TOML format alongside JSON, CSV, TSV |
| **BPM Estimation** | Estimates tempo for WAV and AIFF samples using onset-strength autocorrelation. Shown in the metadata panel with a loading spinner while computing. Cached in memory. BPM appears in the floating player meta line after detection |
| **Command Palette** | Press <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> to open a fuzzy search across all items — plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets, bookmarked directories, tags, tabs, and actions. Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, Escape to dismiss. Uses the same fzf scoring engine as tab search bars |
| **Directory Bookmarks** | Bookmark favorite directories in the File Browser for instant navigation. Chips displayed above the file list, persisted across sessions. Right-click any folder to bookmark it |

## // HOW IT WORKS //

```
[1] SCAN -----> Rust backend crawls platform-specific plugin directories.
                Streams results to the WebView via Tauri events in batches
                of 10. Collects name, type, version, manufacturer, website,
                size, and mod date.

[2] AUDIO ----> Separate scanner discovers audio samples (WAV, FLAC, AIFF,
                MP3, OGG) with metadata extraction. Inline playback via
                Tauri's native asset:// protocol for zero-latency local
                file streaming.

[3] DAW ------> DAW scanner finds project files across 14+ DAW formats
                (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, REAPER, Cubase, Pro Tools,
                Bitwig, Studio One, Reason, Audacity, GarageBand, Ardour,
                dawproject). Tracks file sizes and modification dates.

[4] CHECK ----> Async Rust tasks search KVR Audio for each plugin's product
                page, scrape version info. Falls back to DuckDuckGo
                site:kvraudio.com search. Groups by manufacturer to reduce
                duplicate queries. Cards update in-place as results arrive.
                Status bar shows current plugin and live tallies.

[5] HISTORY --> Each scan is persisted to disk as JSON. Plugin, audio, and
                DAW scans are merged in the history timeline. Diff any two
                snapshots to see what was added, removed, or version-bumped.
                Last scan auto-restores on startup.

[6] EXPORT ---> Export any tab to JSON, TOML, CSV, TSV, or PDF via native
                file dialogs. Import from JSON or TOML.
```

## // KVR AUDIO RATE LIMITING //

This app queries [KVR Audio](https://www.kvraudio.com) to find plugin versions and
download links. To avoid overloading KVR's servers, strict rate limiting is enforced:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Concurrent requests | 1 (sequential) |
| Delay between plugins | 2 seconds |
| Delay between KVR page fetches | 1.5 seconds |
| Delay before DuckDuckGo fallback | 1.5 seconds |
| Max product pages checked per plugin | 2 |

The background KVR resolver (auto-runs on startup) also uses 2-second delays
between plugins. You can stop it anytime with the Stop button.

> With ~2600 plugins at 2s each, a full update check takes roughly 90 minutes.
> Results are cached on each plugin card -- subsequent clicks are instant.
> Use the Stop button to cancel early; already-resolved plugins keep their results.
