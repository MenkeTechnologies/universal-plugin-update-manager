> **// SYSTEM ONLINE -- AUDIO_HAXOR v1.11.0 // by MenkeTechnologies**

A high-voltage **Tauri v2** desktop app that jacks into your system's audio plugin directories, maps every VST2/VST3/AU module it finds, scans audio sample libraries, discovers DAW project files, checks the web for the latest plugin versions, and maintains a full changelog of every scan -- so nothing slips through the cracks. Rust backend with a cyberpunk CRT interface featuring neon glow, scanline overlays, glitch effects, and multiple color schemes.

## // CORE MODULES //

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Plugin Scanner** | Detects VST2, VST3, and AU plugins from platform-specific directories on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Shows architecture badges (ARM64, x86_64, Universal) per plugin via direct Mach-O/PE header parsing. Tracks raw byte sizes for accurate disk usage charts. Runs in a background worker thread -- UI stays fully responsive |
| **Audio Scanner** | Discovers audio samples (WAV, FLAC, AIFF, MP3, OGG, etc.) with metadata extraction including duration, channels, sample rate, bit depth from file headers. Symlink deduplication via canonicalize with string-based fallback. Double-click any sample row to start playback (or single-click with the setting enabled). Floating music player with volume, playback speed, seek bar, and loop controls persists across all tabs |
| **DAW Scanner** | Finds DAW project files across 14+ formats -- Ableton (.als), Logic (.logicx), FL Studio (.flp), REAPER (.rpp), Cubase/Nuendo (.cpr/.npr), Pro Tools (.ptx/.ptf), Bitwig (.bwproject), Studio One (.song), Reason (.reason), Audacity (.aup/.aup3), GarageBand (.band), Ardour (.ardour), and dawproject (.dawproject). Double-click any project row to open it directly in its DAW |
| **Plugin Cross-Reference** | Extracts plugin references from 11 DAW formats: Ableton (.als — gzip XML), REAPER (.rpp — plaintext), Bitwig (.bwproject — binary scan), FL Studio (.flp — ASCII + UTF-16LE), Logic Pro (.logicx — plist + AU name matching), Cubase/Nuendo (.cpr — Plugin Name markers), Studio One (.song — ZIP XML), DAWproject (ZIP XML), Pro Tools (.ptx/.ptf — binary scan), Reason (.reason — binary scan). Detects VST2/VST3/AU/CLAP/AAX. Shows plugin count badges on DAW rows. Click to see full plugin list. Reverse lookup: right-click any plugin to find which projects use it. Build full index across all supported projects with one click |
| **Version Intel** | Reads version, manufacturer, and website URL from macOS bundle plists (`CFBundleShortVersionString`, `CFBundleIdentifier`, `NSHumanReadableCopyright`) |
| **Update Checker** | Searches [KVR Audio](https://www.kvraudio.com) for each plugin's latest version. Falls back to DuckDuckGo site-restricted KVR search. Runs in a worker thread with rate limiting and streams results back incrementally |
| **KVR Integration** | Yellow KVR button on every plugin links directly to its KVR Audio product page. Double-click any plugin card to open it on KVR. URL is constructed from plugin name + manufacturer with smart slug generation (camelCase splitting, manufacturer lookup table). Falls back to KVR search if the direct URL doesn't exist |
| **KVR Cache** | Resolved KVR data (product URLs, download links, versions) persisted to SQLite. On restart, cached results are restored instantly and the background resolver resumes from where it left off |
| **Download Button** | Green download button appears on plugins with a confirmed newer version and a KVR download link (platform-specific when available) |
| **Export/Import** | Export all tabs (plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets) to JSON, TOML, CSV, or TSV via native file dialogs. Import from JSON or TOML. Format auto-detected from file extension |
| **Scan History** | Stores up to 50 scan snapshots in SQLite (plugins, audio, DAW, and preset scans merged) with full diff support between any two scans |
| **Batch Updater** | Walk through all outdated plugins one by one with skip/open controls |
| **Manufacturer Link** | Globe button on each plugin opens the manufacturer's website directly (derived from bundle ID). Shows a disabled icon when no website is available |
| **Reveal in Finder** | Folder button opens the plugin's filesystem location. Double-click any preset row to reveal it in Finder. Tooltip shows the full path on hover |
| **Directory Breakdown** | Expandable table showing plugin counts and type breakdown per scanned directory |
| **Stop Control** | Cancel any in-progress scan, update check, or KVR resolution without losing already-discovered results |
| **Auto-Restore** | Last scan results + KVR cache load automatically on app startup -- no need to re-scan or re-check every launch |
| **Unknown Tracking** | Plugins where no version info was found online show "Unknown Latest" badge and are counted separately from "Up to Date" |
| **Color Schemes** | Multiple themes including cyberpunk (default), light mode, and custom schemes with configurable CSS variables |
| **Fuzzy Search** | All search bars default to fuzzy matching (characters match in order, not contiguous). Toggle the `.*` button to switch to regex mode with full pattern support. Available in all tabs |
| **Favorites** | Right-click any plugin, sample, DAW project, or preset to add/remove from favorites. Dedicated Favorites tab shows all starred items with type filter, search, reveal in Finder, and remove actions. Persisted across sessions |
| **Resizable Columns** | Drag column borders to resize. Widths persist across sessions |
| **Floating Player** | Draggable audio player that docks to any corner with quadrant zone UI. Resizable from all 8 edges/corners. Play/pause, loop, shuffle, seek bar, volume, speed (0.25x-2x), recently played (50 tracks), song search with fzf matching, favorite/tag buttons. Expanded mode adds 3-band EQ, preamp gain, stereo pan, mono toggle, A-B loop. 60fps waveform playhead via requestAnimationFrame. Player state/size/dock persisted across sessions |
| **Waveform Preview** | 800-subdivision min/max envelope waveform with gradient fill (cyan→magenta) and RMS center detail line. Seekable — click anywhere to jump. 60fps playhead cursor. Right-click to toggle expand setting. File browser shows full-width waveform background behind each audio row with live playback cursor |
| **Dependency Graph** | Visual plugin dependency map with search, 4 tabs (Most Used, By Project with inline drill-down + back button, Orphaned, Analytics). Analytics tab shows format breakdown, top manufacturers, key insights (avg plugins/project, single-use, go-to plugins). Prompts to build plugin index if empty. Persisted xref cache |
| **Project Viewer** | Right-click any DAW project → "Explore Project Contents". XML formats (ALS, Studio One, DAWproject) show collapsible XML tree with search. Text formats (REAPER) show plaintext with search. Binary formats (Bitwig, FLP, Logic, Cubase, Pro Tools, Reason) show JSON tree of extracted metadata, plugins, and preset states. Collapse All/Expand All buttons. Color-coded: tags cyan, attributes yellow, values green |
| **Context Menus** | 40+ right-click context menus on every interactive element — plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets, favorites, notes, tags, history entries, audio player songs, dep graph rows, file browser rows, breadcrumbs, waveforms, spectrograms, EQ sliders, color schemes, shortcut keys, progress bars, metadata panels, similar panel, heatmap dashboard, header stats, **visualizer tiles** (export PNG, copy label, fullscreen, per-mode FFT/waveform/spectrogram/levels options), **smart playlist** items and editor. **All menu labels** use `appFmt('menu.*')` / `appFmt('ui.sp_*')` from `i18n/app_i18n_*.json` (SQLite `app_i18n`); optional `skipEchoToast` (`…_noEcho`) suppresses duplicate post-click toasts when the action already shows a toast. `scripts/apply_context_menu_i18n.py` can re-apply bulk label→key mapping after large edits |
| **Toast & UI i18n** | Slide-in toasts plus **visible** UI text: `index.html` uses `data-i18n` (labels), `data-i18n-placeholder`, and `data-i18n-title`; `scripts/gen_app_i18n_en.py` extracts strings, merges prior `ui.*` from `i18n/app_i18n_en.json`, injects attributes, and emits the English catalog. Dynamic strings use `appFmt` with keys from `UI_JS_EN` in that script (e.g. plugin scan states, settings Light/Dark/On/Off). Confirm dialogs, help overlay, and native menu/tray labels load from SQLite `app_i18n`. The **command palette** (Cmd+K) uses the same `appFmt` keys for tab names, actions, placeholders (`ui.palette.*`), and type badges. German (`de`), Spanish (`es`), Swedish (`sv`), and French (`fr`) seeds are generated from English via `scripts/gen_app_i18n_de.py` / `gen_app_i18n_es.py` / `gen_app_i18n_sv.py` / `gen_app_i18n_fr.py` (venv + `deep-translator`). Settings → **Interface language** sets `uiLocale`. `reloadAppStrings` runs `applyUiI18n()`, `refreshSettingsUI()`, and the Rust command `refresh_native_menu` so the **native menu bar** (File, Edit, Scan, View, …) matches the selected locale without restarting |
| **Disk Usage** | Stacked bar charts showing space breakdown by format/type per tab. Visual representation of storage usage with color-coded legends |
| **Batch Selection** | Checkbox column in all tables for multi-item operations. Select all/deselect, batch favorite, copy paths, export selected as JSON |
| **Duplicate Detection** | Find duplicate files by name+size across plugins, samples, DAW projects, and presets. Modal report grouped by type with full paths |
| **Notes & Tags** | Add notes and comma-separated tags to any item (plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets, directories, files) via right-click. Visual badges (★ star, 📝 note, green tag pills) appear inline AFTER the name in all table rows, plugin cards, and file browser. Badges update in real-time when adding/removing favorites, tags, or notes |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Arrow keys/j/k to navigate table rows and file browser (Ableton-style: right enters dir, left goes up). 49 customizable keybindings including Cmd+1-9/0 for all 10 tabs, E expand player, Q toggle EQ, U mono, D dashboard, B A-B loop, Cmd+P new playlist |
| **Help Overlay** | Press <kbd>?</kbd> to show all 49 keyboard shortcuts. Covers navigation, playback, actions, search operators, and mouse interactions |
| **Sort Persistence** | Last-used sort column and direction saved per tab, restored on app restart |
| **Multi-Select Filters** | All filter dropdowns support multiple selections (e.g. VST2 + AU, WAV + FLAC). Checkbox-based custom dropdown with "All" toggle |
| **Native Menu Bar** | Full menu bar (app, File, Edit, Scan, View, Playback, Data, Tools, Window, Help). Top-level and item labels use `menu.*` / `tray.*` in SQLite `app_i18n`; `refresh_native_menu` rebuilds the bar when the interface language changes |
| **ETA Timers** | Estimated time remaining on plugin scans and update checks. Elapsed time on audio, DAW, and preset scans |
| **Trello Drag & Drop** | Unified Trello-style drag and drop everywhere: tabs, settings sections, audio player sections, table columns (audio/DAW/preset), header stats, stats bars, favorites list, recently played queue, file browser bookmarks, tag cards, note cards, plugin cards, color presets. Floating ghost clone + dashed placeholder. All orders persisted |
| **Draggable/Resizable Modals** | All modal windows (dashboard, dep graph, ALS viewer, duplicate report, similarity, export/import) are draggable via header and resizable from 8 edges/corners. Position/size persisted to prefs per modal |

## // QUICK START //

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/Audio-Haxor.git
cd Audio-Haxor

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for distribution
pnpm tauri build
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/). The Tauri CLI is pulled in as a dev dependency.

---

## // DEV vs BUILD — IMPORTANT //

**Dev (`pnpm tauri dev`) and Build (`pnpm tauri build`) behave differently.** Always verify in the build before shipping.

### Differences

| | Dev | Build |
|---|---|---|
| URL scheme | `http://localhost` | `tauri://localhost` |
| CSP | Relaxed | Strict (no inline JS) |
| Frontend | Served from disk (live) | Embedded in binary |
| WebView cache | None (dev server) | Aggressive (survives app restart) |
| CSS layout | Standard web | Slightly different height inheritance |
| Canvas | `clientWidth` stable | `clientWidth` can fluctuate |

### Rules

1. **Never use inline `onclick`/`onchange`** — blocked by CSP in build. Always use `addEventListener` in JS files.
2. **Never set `canvas.width`/`canvas.height` in a render loop** — causes infinite resize loops in build. Set once, or use fixed HTML attributes with CSS `width:100%;height:100%`.
3. **Never rely on `height: 100%` cascading** — use explicit pixel values.
4. **Guard cross-file function calls** with `typeof fn === 'function'` — script load order differs.
5. **Don't use CSS classes on dynamically created elements** if the class has layout-affecting styles — use inline styles or dedicated CSS classes that only set visual properties.
6. **Never use `box-shadow`, `animation`, `transition`, `background-image` (gradient), `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements, or `position: relative` on elements inside CSS columns layout** — WebKit's release renderer creates GPU compositing layers for these properties that corrupt child text rendering, bar charts, and dynamic content. Elements go black, render at wrong sizes, or flicker on hover. Only plain `border`, `background-color`, and `padding` are safe inside CSS columns.
7. **Defer percentage-based widths on flex children inside modals** — `width:X%` on flex children (bar charts, progress bars) renders at wrong values on first paint because the flex container width isn't resolved yet. Set `width:0` initially, store the target in `data-bar-pct`, then apply via `requestAnimationFrame` after the modal is visible.

### Cache Busting

Build looks different from dev? Clear **all 4** WebView cache directories:

```bash
find ~/Library/WebKit/audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/WebKit/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/Caches/audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/Caches/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     -delete 2>/dev/null
```

Also bump the `?v=XXX` query strings on all `<script>` tags in `index.html` to bust compiled JS bytecode cache.

### Build Commands

```bash
# Normal build (~14s)
pnpm tauri build

# Clean build (when frontend changes aren't picked up, ~40s)
cargo clean --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --release && pnpm tauri build

# Nuclear option: clear caches + clean build
find ~/Library/WebKit/audio-haxor ~/Library/WebKit/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/Caches/audio-haxor ~/Library/Caches/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     -delete 2>/dev/null
cargo clean --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --release && pnpm tauri build
```

### Data Location

All data persists at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor/
  audio_haxor.db        -- SQLite database (all scans, caches, history)
  preferences.toml      -- User preferences (human-readable config)
  app.log               -- Error log
```
This directory survives app reinstalls. Never deleted by builds.

### NPM Scripts

```bash
pnpm run clean      # Remove src-tauri/target, dist, node_modules/.cache
pnpm run rebuild    # Clean + full release build
pnpm test           # JS + Rust tests
pnpm run doc        # Rust API docs → src-tauri/target/doc/
pnpm run doc:open   # Same + open app_lib docs in browser
pnpm run doc:sync   # Regenerate rustdoc and copy to docs/api/ + use docs/index.html
```

---

## // TESTING //

```bash
# Run all tests (JS + Rust `app_lib` unit tests — see `scripts/test.sh`; integration binaries like `behavioral_ultra` / `app_i18n_test` use `cargo test --tests` or per-`--test` flags)
pnpm test

# Run Rust backend tests only
cd src-tauri && cargo test

# Run all JavaScript tests (`test/*.test.js`; `scripts/run-js-tests.mjs` batches argv so Windows stays under the ~8191-char command-line limit)
pnpm run test:js

# Spot-check a few files only
node --test test/scanner.test.js test/update-worker.test.js test/ui.test.js
```

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm run test:js`, `cargo test --lib`, and `cargo test --test behavioral_ultra --test app_i18n_test` in `src-tauri/`, then `pnpm run tauri:build:ci` (`tauri build --ci --no-sign`) for unsigned release bundles on each OS. `db::init_global` is idempotent: a process-wide mutex serializes the first `Database::open` + migrations on the on-disk `audio_haxor.db` so parallel test threads do not run migrations concurrently (which would raise SQLite `database is locked` on busy CI runners). The global handle is still stored in `OnceLock`.

### Rust tests (`cargo test` from `src-tauri/`)

Unit tests live in `src/**/*.rs` inside `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Integration tests live in `tests/*.rs` (one Cargo test binary per file), each importing `app_lib`. To tally `#[test]` functions without hardcoding: `cd src-tauri && rg -c '#\[test\]' src` and `rg -c '#\[test\]' tests`. A few tests are `#[ignore]` (long migrations, heavy DB batches, optional stress); run `cargo test -- --ignored` to include them.

**`app_lib` unit tests — modules in `src/`**

| Module | Tests | Coverage |

Locale JSON for seeding lives under `i18n/` (`include_str!` from `app_i18n.rs`). Run: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test behavioral_ultra` (and `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test app_i18n_test` for DB-backed `get_app_strings` checks; CI runs both).

**Handcrafted table suites** (`tests/handcrafted_tables_*.rs`): many small `#[test]` functions generated from declarative macros, each row an explicit input/expected pair for pure helpers — `kvr::parse_version` (split across `handcrafted_tables_kvr`, `handcrafted_tables_kvr_parse_many`, and `handcrafted_tables_kvr_parse_batch2`), `kvr::compare_versions` (strict chain + 50 pairs), `kvr::extract_version` (HTML snippets), `format_size`, `history::radix_string`, `similarity::fingerprint_distance`, DAW `ext_matches` / `daw_name_for_format`, and scanner/xref normalization. **`handcrafted_tables_massive`** adds thousands of one-function-per-row checks for `parse_version`, `compare_versions` on a sorted semver-like grid, and `format_size` (powers of two, linear byte ranges, and 1 MiB boundary). **`handcrafted_tables_normalize_generated`** is emitted by `cargo run --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --example norm_gen` — one test per plugin-name × arch-suffix combination against the real `xref::normalize_plugin_name`. **`handcrafted_tables_fingerprint_grid`** pins `fingerprint_distance` to reference values on RMS and spectral-centroid grids (symmetry + explicit distance). **`handcrafted_tables_radix_grid`** covers `radix_string` for bases 2–36 and `n ∈ [0, 119)`. **`handcrafted_tables_daw_path_bulk`** exercises `ext_matches` across every registered DAW suffix × path prefix × file stem. Run e.g. `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test handcrafted_tables_massive`.

| **`test/radix-string-bulk.test.js`** | 1200 | `radix_string` algorithm vs `Number.prototype.toString(base)` on the same grid as `handcrafted_tables_radix_grid`. |
| **`test/daw-ext-matcher-bulk.test.js`** | 612 | Same path matrix as `handcrafted_tables_daw_path_bulk` for DAW `ext_matches` semantics. |
| **`test/*.test.js` (other bulk)** | 832 | fzf-style scoring, string/array/math utilities, other formatting — **not** the full `frontend/js/utils.js` module graph. |

**What these tests do *not* cover (by design):**

- **No WebView / DOM** — nothing drives `document`, `applyFilter`, `registerFilter`, multi-filter widgets, or `saveFilterState` / `restoreFilterStates` against real HTML.
- **No Tauri IPC** — no invoke/events; no live `scanner.js` / `plugins.js` integration.
- **No E2E** — no Playwright/Cypress; behavior is **shallow unit** checks on isolated or duplicated logic.

So: strong coverage for **formatting, escaping, scoring, and math-style helpers**; **not** a substitute for manual QA or future browser E2E tests for filters, tabs, or stateful UI.

## // API DOCUMENTATION (RUST — HTML) //

Rust API docs (rustdoc) are generated for the `app_lib` crate:

```bash
# Generate HTML under src-tauri/target/doc/ (opens in browser)
pnpm doc:open

# Regenerate and copy a browsable tree into docs/api/ (for GitHub Pages or offline)
pnpm doc:sync
```

After `pnpm doc:sync`, open `docs/index.html` in a browser, or open `docs/api/app_lib/index.html` directly. The canonical build output is always `src-tauri/target/doc/app_lib/index.html`.

| `get_audio_metadata` (WAV) | 4.8 µs |
| `gen_id` | 42 ns |

Scanner architecture: each scanner (plugins, audio, DAW, presets) runs on its own dedicated rayon thread pool (`num_cpus × 2` threads, min 4) with `sync_channel(2048)` buffering and non-blocking `try_recv` drain loops. All 4 scanners run fully in parallel via `Promise.all`. Optimized for I/O-bound workloads including SMB/NFS network mounts where high thread counts overlap network round-trip latency.

```bash
cargo bench --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

## // BUILD & DISTRIBUTE //

```bash
# Build optimized release bundle
pnpm tauri:build
```

Built packages land in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

| Platform | Format | Output |
|----------|--------|--------|
| macOS    | App Bundle | `AUDIO_HAXOR.app` |
| macOS    | DMG    | `AUDIO_HAXOR_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg` |
| Windows  | NSIS   | `AUDIO_HAXOR Setup x.x.x.exe` |
| Windows  | MSI    | `AUDIO_HAXOR_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi` |
| Linux    | AppImage | `audio-haxor_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage` |
| Linux    | Debian   | `audio-haxor_x.x.x_amd64.deb` |

## // HOW IT WORKS //

```
[1] SCAN -----> Rust backend crawls platform-specific plugin directories.
                Streams results to the WebView via Tauri events in batches
                of 10. Collects name, type, version, manufacturer, website,
                size, and mod date.

[2] AUDIO ----> Separate scanner discovers audio samples (WAV, FLAC, AIFF,
                MP3, OGG) with metadata extraction. Inline playback via
                Tauri's native asset:// protocol for zero-latency local
                file streaming.

[3] DAW ------> DAW scanner finds project files across 14+ DAW formats
                (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, REAPER, Cubase, Pro Tools,
                Bitwig, Studio One, Reason, Audacity, GarageBand, Ardour,
                dawproject). Tracks file sizes and modification dates.

[4] CHECK ----> Async Rust tasks search KVR Audio for each plugin's product
                page, scrape version info. Falls back to DuckDuckGo
                site:kvraudio.com search. Groups by manufacturer to reduce
                duplicate queries. Cards update in-place as results arrive.
                Status bar shows current plugin and live tallies.

[5] HISTORY --> Each scan is persisted to SQLite. Plugin, audio, DAW, and
                preset scans are merged in the history timeline. Diff any two
                snapshots to see what was added, removed, or version-bumped.
                Last scan auto-restores on startup.

[6] EXPORT ---> Export any tab to JSON, TOML, CSV, TSV, or PDF via native
                file dialogs. Import from JSON or TOML.
```

## // KVR AUDIO RATE LIMITING //

This app queries [KVR Audio](https://www.kvraudio.com) to find plugin versions and
download links. To avoid overloading KVR's servers, strict rate limiting is enforced:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Concurrent requests | 1 (sequential) |
| Delay between plugins | 2 seconds |
| Delay between KVR page fetches | 1.5 seconds |
| Delay before DuckDuckGo fallback | 1.5 seconds |
| Max product pages checked per plugin | 2 |

The background KVR resolver (auto-runs on startup) also uses 2-second delays
between plugins. You can stop it anytime with the Stop button.

> With ~2600 plugins at 2s each, a full update check takes roughly 90 minutes.
> Results are cached on each plugin card -- subsequent clicks are instant.
> Use the Stop button to cancel early; already-resolved plugins keep their results.
