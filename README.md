> **// SYSTEM ONLINE -- AUDIO_HAXOR v1.11.0 // by MenkeTechnologies**

A high-voltage **Tauri v2** desktop app that jacks into your system's audio plugin directories, maps every VST2/VST3/AU/CLAP module it finds, scans audio sample libraries, discovers DAW project files, checks the web for the latest plugin versions, and maintains a full changelog of every scan -- so nothing slips through the cracks. Rust backend with a cyberpunk CRT interface featuring neon glow, scanline overlays, glitch effects, and multiple color schemes.

## // CORE MODULES //

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Plugin Scanner** | Detects VST2, VST3, AU, and CLAP plugins from platform-specific directories on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Shows architecture badges (ARM64, x86_64, Universal) per plugin via direct Mach-O/PE header parsing. Tracks raw byte sizes for accurate disk usage charts. Runs in a background worker thread -- UI stays fully responsive |
| **Audio Scanner** | Discovers audio samples (WAV, FLAC, AIFF, MP3, OGG, etc.) with metadata extraction including duration, channels, sample rate, bit depth from file headers. Symlink deduplication via canonicalize with string-based fallback. By default, **Single-Click Sample Playback** and **Play on Keyboard Selection** are on (Settings → Playback to disable). With keyboard selection, if the metadata row is expanded, it follows the highlighted row. Double-click still works when single-click is off. **Drag files to a DAW, Finder, or Desktop:** on Samples, DAW, Presets, MIDI, PDF, Plugins, Favorites, Notes, Files, and from the similarity panel — move the pointer slightly (≈8px) before release, then drag from the row/card (not action buttons); native OS file drag. The drag **preview** is a canvas-rendered cyberpunk tile (neon frame, scanlines, mini spectrum, `COPY` badge) tinted from the active **color scheme** (`--cyan` / `--magenta` / `--accent`); it refreshes when you change schemes. Tabs with batch checkboxes drag all selected rows when the dragged row is part of the selection. Floating music player with volume, playback speed, seek bar, and loop controls persists across all tabs |
| **DAW Scanner** | Finds DAW project files across 14+ formats -- Ableton (.als), Logic (.logicx), FL Studio (.flp), REAPER (.rpp), Cubase/Nuendo (.cpr/.npr), Pro Tools (.ptx/.ptf), Bitwig (.bwproject), Studio One (.song), Reason (.reason), Audacity (.aup/.aup3), GarageBand (.band), Ardour (.ardour), and dawproject (.dawproject). Double-click any project row to open it directly in its DAW |
| **Plugin Cross-Reference** | Extracts plugin references from 11 DAW formats: Ableton (.als — gzip XML), REAPER (.rpp — plaintext), Bitwig (.bwproject — binary scan), FL Studio (.flp — ASCII + UTF-16LE), Logic Pro (.logicx — plist + AU name matching), Cubase/Nuendo (.cpr — Plugin Name markers), Studio One (.song — ZIP XML), DAWproject (ZIP XML), Pro Tools (.ptx/.ptf — binary scan), Reason (.reason — binary scan). Detects VST2/VST3/AU/CLAP/AAX. Shows plugin count badges on DAW rows. Click to see full plugin list. Reverse lookup: right-click any plugin to find which projects use it. Build full index across all supported projects with one click |
| **Version Intel** | Reads version, manufacturer, and website URL from macOS bundle plists (`CFBundleShortVersionString`, `CFBundleIdentifier`, `NSHumanReadableCopyright`) |
| **Update Checker** | Searches [KVR Audio](https://www.kvraudio.com) for each plugin's latest version. Falls back to DuckDuckGo site-restricted KVR search. Runs in a worker thread with rate limiting and streams results back incrementally |
| **KVR Integration** | Yellow KVR button on every plugin links directly to its KVR Audio product page. Double-click any plugin card to open it on KVR. URL is constructed from plugin name + manufacturer with smart slug generation (camelCase splitting, manufacturer lookup table). Falls back to KVR search if the direct URL doesn't exist |
| **KVR Cache** | Resolved KVR data (product URLs, download links, versions) persisted to SQLite. On restart, cached results are restored instantly and the background resolver resumes from where it left off |
| **Download Button** | Green download button appears on plugins with a confirmed newer version and a KVR download link (platform-specific when available) |
| **Export/Import** | Export all tabs (plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets, MIDI, PDFs) to JSON, TOML, CSV, or TSV via native file dialogs. Import from JSON or TOML. Format auto-detected from file extension. **Export modal row counts and SQLite fetch limits** use the **filtered** total (`totalCount` for the active search/filters), not the whole-library `totalUnfiltered`. Stale in-memory totals are refreshed with a one-row DB probe (same idea as DAW’s `dbDawFilterStats` path) |
| **Scan History** | Stores scan snapshots in SQLite (plugins, audio, DAW, preset, PDF, and MIDI scans merged in one timeline) with full diff support between any two scans of the same type. Sidebar scan-type tags use `menu.tab_*` i18n keys (same strings as the main tabs) |
| **Batch Updater** | Walk through all outdated plugins one by one with skip/open controls |
| **Manufacturer Link** | Globe button on each plugin opens the manufacturer's website directly (derived from bundle ID). Shows a disabled icon when no website is available |
| **Reveal in Finder** | Folder button opens the plugin's filesystem location. Double-click any preset row to reveal it in Finder. Tooltip shows the full path on hover |
| **Directory Breakdown** | Expandable table showing plugin counts and type breakdown per scanned directory |
| **Stop Control** | Cancel any in-progress scan, update check, or KVR resolution without losing already-discovered results. **Scan All** calls `prepare_unified_scan` before the delayed `scan_unified` invoke so Stop All during that window is not cleared when the walk starts (`scan_unified` no longer resets `stop_scan` at entry). The header **Stop All** button is not hidden when KVR resolve or an update check finishes while **Scan All** is still active (those flows share the same control; `hideStopButton` skips clearing it while `btnScanAll` is disabled). Startup `loadLastScan` uses the same rule so a late i18n load cannot hide Stop All after an early Scan All |
| **Post-scan toasts** | In-app slide-in toasts when each scanner finishes (`toast.post_scan_*` keys): full completion vs user-stopped, with locale-formatted counts. **Scan All** sets `window.__suppressPostScanToasts` so only one summary toast runs (library totals via `get_active_scan_inventory_counts`) |
| **Auto-Restore** | Last scan results + KVR cache load automatically on app startup -- no need to re-scan or re-check every launch |
| **Unknown Tracking** | Plugins where no version info was found online show "Unknown Latest" badge and are counted separately from "Up to Date" |
| **Color Schemes** | Multiple themes including cyberpunk (default), light mode, and custom schemes with configurable CSS variables. Modals, context menus, and the command palette use `color-mix`/`var(--bg-card)` for frosted panels (not a fixed dark tint) so light mode matches |
| **Fuzzy Search** | All search bars default to fuzzy matching (characters match in order, not contiguous). Toggle the `.*` button to switch to regex mode with full pattern support. **Samples** tab: regex mode runs real case-insensitive matching in SQLite via a `regexp` user function (Rust `regex` crate), not FTS5 phrase search — patterns like `F[a][n]` match `Fan` as in JavaScript. Other tabs may still use substring/LIKE or FTS for server-side filtering; client-side `searchScore` regex applies to visible rows. Matched characters are highlighted (cyan) in list and table rows |
| **Favorites** | Right-click any plugin, sample, DAW project, or preset to add/remove from favorites. Dedicated Favorites tab shows all starred items with type filter, search, reveal in Finder, and remove actions. Persisted across sessions |
| **Resizable Columns** | Drag column borders to resize. Widths persist across sessions |
| **Floating Player** | Draggable audio player that docks to any corner with quadrant zone UI. Resizable from all 8 edges/corners. Play/pause, loop, shuffle (default **S**, customizable in Settings → Shortcuts), seek bar, volume, speed (0.25x-2x), optional **reverse** playback (decodes the file and plays the buffer backwards through the same EQ chain), recently played (50 tracks), song search with fzf matching, favorite/tag buttons. Expanded mode adds 3-band EQ, preamp gain, stereo pan, mono toggle, A-B loop. 60fps waveform playhead via requestAnimationFrame. **Library playback through the audio-engine sidecar** drives the FFT from **`playback_status.spectrum`** (Web Audio’s analyser is not fed in that mode). The mini-spectrum FFT uses one pass over bins for the filled curve and stroke. **`ensureAudioGraph()`** runs before FFT sampling (and the `AudioContext` is resumed when suspended) so local `<audio>` playback shows spectrum; parametric EQ knob drag uses **`pointermove` / `pointerup` on `window`** so mouse release works in WKWebView; FFT/EQ canvases track container width via **`ResizeObserver`**, **`getBoundingClientRect`**, and flex **`min-width: 0`**. **Spectrum strip height** is adjustable via the drag handle under the FFT (32–480px, `npFftHeight`); **parametric EQ canvas** height uses the handle under the EQ plot (80–480px, `npEqCanvasHeight`). Player state/size/dock persisted across sessions |
| **Waveform Preview** | 800-subdivision min/max envelope waveform with gradient fill (cyan→magenta) and RMS center detail line. Seekable — click anywhere on the now-playing bar to jump; the expanded sample metadata row waveform seeks the same way when that file is the current track. 60fps playhead cursor. Right-click to toggle expand setting. **Playback is highest priority:** now-playing and expanded-row waveform/spectrogram work is deferred with **`setTimeout(0)`** (not `requestIdleCallback`, which is often starved in Tauri/WKWebView so those draws never ran); pending timers are cleared with `clearTimeout` on track/row change so fetch/decode/FFT never run on the synchronous path right after `play()`. **`resolveWaveformBoxSize`** waits for rAF until the waveform container has non-zero dimensions (otherwise bar count was 0 and the canvas stayed blank). **`fileSrcForDecode`** uses **`__TAURI__.core.convertFileSrc`** first (then `window.convertFileSrc` from **`ipc.js`**). **Expanded** metadata row: when **single-click play** is on, **`toggleMetadata`** awaits **`previewAudio`** before **`expandMetaForPath`** so waveform/spectrogram work does not race **`enginePlaybackStart`** / **`audio.play()`**; **`drawMetaPanelVisuals`** prefers the **audio-engine** sidecar (**`audio_engine_invoke`**: **`waveform_preview`** + **`spectrogram_preview`** on the sample’s absolute path; spectrogram **`width_px`/`height_px`** are capped modestly via **`metaSpectrogramEnginePixelDims`** to keep IPC JSON small), then **`decodeMetaVisualsViaWorker`** / related worker paths; on failure it falls back to main-thread **`drawMetaWaveform`** → **`drawSpectrogram`** (shared **`_metaSharedDecoded`** buffer when both caches miss). **Prev/next** with an expanded row awaits **`previewAudio`** before re-expanding. **Now-playing** peaks and **file-browser** list-row mini waveforms: **`decodePeaksViaWorker`** — worker-first via **`frontend/js/audio-decode-worker.js`**, with main-thread fetch + transfer or decode fallbacks. **Reverse** playback: **`decodeChannelsViaWorker`** + chunked **`copyFloat32ToBufferChannelAsync`** into the playback buffer and **`reverseAudioBufferAsync`** (yields during long reversals); if no **`Worker`**, **`decodeAudioData`** on the main thread. **`preloadAudioDecodeWorker`**: idle + ~650ms after splash fade. Each new track bumps a generation counter so in-flight decode for a previous track is abandoned |
| **Dependency Graph** | Visual plugin dependency map with search, 4 tabs (Most Used, By Project with inline drill-down + back button, Orphaned, Analytics). Analytics tab shows format breakdown, top manufacturers, key insights (avg plugins/project, single-use, go-to plugins). Prompts to build plugin index if empty. Persisted xref cache. Graph data uses **xref cache paths**; project names come from the DAW list when the row is loaded, otherwise from the file path (paginated SQLite DAW tab does not keep every project in `allDawProjects`) |
| **Project Viewer** | Right-click any DAW project → "Explore Project Contents". XML formats (ALS, Studio One, DAWproject) show collapsible XML tree with search. Text formats (REAPER) show plaintext with search. Binary formats (Bitwig, FLP, Logic, Cubase, Pro Tools, Reason) show JSON tree of extracted metadata, plugins, and preset states. Collapse All/Expand All buttons. Color-coded: tags cyan, attributes yellow, values green |
| **Context Menus** | 40+ right-click menus on named surfaces — plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets, **MIDI** (tab bar → rescan/export), favorites, notes, tags, history entries, audio player songs, dep graph rows, file browser rows, breadcrumbs, waveforms, spectrograms, EQ sliders, color schemes, shortcut keys, progress bars, metadata panels, similar panel, heatmap dashboard, header stats, **visualizer tiles** (export PNG, copy label, fullscreen, per-mode FFT/waveform/spectrogram/levels options), **smart playlist** items and editor, walker tiles, settings rows (toggles, selects, ranges, action buttons), settings sections. **Universal fallback**: any other right-click inside the app shell (empty tab area, dock overlay, tag bar gaps, etc.) still opens a menu (copy selection / value / visible text, activate `data-action` controls, focus, Command Palette, keyboard shortcuts, Settings). **Settings rows** without only a toggle or textarea now include copy/focus/reset for selects and ranges. **Tab bar** “scan this tab” uses the same `menu.scan_plugins`, `menu.scan_samples`, `menu.scan_daw`, `menu.scan_presets`, `menu.scan_pdf`, and `menu.scan_midi` keys as the Scan menu (not a single generic rescan string). **Scan toolbars** (`.audio-toolbar`) on Plugins, Samples, DAW, Presets, **MIDI**, and **PDF** tabs expose the same scan / export / import / find-duplicates menu (MIDI/PDF were added for parity). **All menu labels** use `appFmt('menu.*')` / `appFmt('ui.sp_*')` from `i18n/app_i18n_*.json` (SQLite `app_i18n`); rare DOM fallbacks use `menu.context_walker_fallback` / `menu.context_settings_section_fallback`. Optional `skipEchoToast` (`…_noEcho` on each item) suppresses duplicate post-click toasts when the action already shows a toast; the handler does not rely on English-only label matching. `scripts/apply_context_menu_i18n.py` can re-apply bulk label→key mapping after large edits |
| **Toast & UI i18n** | Supported locale codes are defined once in `frontend/js/ipc.js` as `SUPPORTED_UI_LOCALES` (also exposed as `window.SUPPORTED_UI_LOCALES`). Slide-in toasts plus **visible** UI text: `index.html` uses `data-i18n` (labels), `data-i18n-placeholder`, and `data-i18n-title`; `scripts/gen_app_i18n_en.py` extracts strings, merges prior `ui.*` from `i18n/app_i18n_en.json`, injects attributes, and emits the English catalog. New keys are often added via `scripts/merge_i18n_keys.py` + `scripts/sync_locale_keys_from_en.py` (see `scripts/README-i18n.md`). Dynamic strings use `appFmt` with keys from `UI_JS_EN` in that script (e.g. plugin scan states, settings Light/Dark/On/Off). **JS-built UI** also uses `appFmt`: welcome dashboard stats and byte/uptime units (`ui.welcome.*`, `ui.unit.*`), keyboard shortcut labels (`ui.shortcut.*`), color scheme grid and fzf weight labels (`ui.scheme.*`, `ui.fzf.*`), export/import modals and PDF column headers (`ui.export.*`), heatmap dashboard (`ui.hm.*`), smart playlist empty state (`ui.sp.empty_state`), EQ band labels (`ui.eq.*`), **Settings → System / performance** and app-info panes (`ui.perf.*`), plus splash/dock/player chrome (`ui.splash.*`, `ui.dock.*`, `ui.np.*`), stats bar / header abbreviations (`ui.stats.*`, `ui.hdr.*`), tab empty-state copy (`ui.p.*`), audio scan/table/player strings (`ui.audio.*`), **sortable table column headers** in PDF/DAW/preset/MIDI tabs and the plugin-scan directory table (`appTableCol()` in `utils.js` with `ui.export.col_*`, `ui.col.*`, `ui.midi.th_time`), plus **header tooltips** (`title`) on audio/MIDI columns (`ui.audio.tt_sort_*`, `ui.midi.tt_sort_*`), settings cache/Data Files panes (`ui.settings.*`), and scan-status badge labels (`ui.scan_status.*`). Workflow for adding keys and locales: `scripts/README-i18n.md`. Confirm dialogs, help overlay, and native menu/tray labels load from SQLite `app_i18n`. The **command palette** (Cmd+K) uses the same `appFmt` keys for tab names, actions, placeholders (`ui.palette.*`), and type badges. Non-English locale catalogs (`cs`, `da`, `de`, `es`, `sv`, `fr`, `nl`, `pt`, `it`, `el`, `pl`, `ru`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`, `fi`, `nb`, `tr`, `hu`, `ro`) are built from English via `scripts/gen_app_i18n_*.py` (venv + `deep-translator`; re-run when `app_i18n_en.json` grows), or stub-synced with `scripts/sync_locale_keys_from_en.py` (see `scripts/README-i18n.md` for per-locale commands). Settings → **Interface language** saves `uiLocale` to prefs only; **restart the app** to load strings. On launch, `reloadAppStrings` runs `applyUiI18n()`, `refreshSettingsUI()`, shortcut list refresh, and `refresh_native_menu` so the Web UI and **native menu bar** (File, Edit, Scan, View, …) match the saved locale |
| **Disk Usage** | Stacked bar charts showing space breakdown by format/type per tab. Visual representation of storage usage with color-coded legends |
| **Batch Selection** | Checkbox column in all tables for multi-item operations. Select all/deselect, batch favorite, copy paths, export selected as JSON |
| **Duplicate Detection** | **By name:** plugins with the same name; samples, DAW projects, and presets with the same name+format. **By content:** optional SHA-256 pass over the whole library (plugins, samples, DAW, presets, PDFs, MIDI) — groups by stored size first, then hashes only size collisions. Modal has two tabs; byte scan streams progress events |
| **Notes & Tags** | Add notes and comma-separated tags to any item (plugins, samples, DAW projects, presets, directories, files) via right-click. Visual badges (★ star, 📝 note, green tag pills) appear inline AFTER the name in all table rows, plugin cards, and file browser. Badges update in real-time when adding/removing favorites, tags, or notes |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Arrow keys and **j/k without Cmd/Ctrl** to navigate table rows and file browser (Ableton-style: right enters dir, left goes up) — **Cmd+K** / **Ctrl+K** is reserved for the command palette. On the **Samples** tab, movement keys apply to the main library table (not the audio player’s recently played list). Customizable shortcuts (Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts) cover tabs (including F-key rows for later tabs), playback, scans, palette, and actions; the help overlay summarizes defaults plus a “more” block bound to the same catalog |
| **Help Overlay** | Press <kbd>?</kbd> for a shortcuts reference (navigation, playback, actions, fzf operators, mouse, and **More shortcuts** populated from Settings). Full list and rebinding live under **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts** |
| **Sort Persistence** | Last-used sort column and direction saved per tab, restored on app restart |
| **Multi-Select Filters** | All filter dropdowns support multiple selections (e.g. VST2 + AU, WAV + FLAC). Checkbox-based custom dropdown with "All" toggle. **Plugins → status** filters against `kvr_cache` in SQLite (same `manufacturer|||name` key as the KVR updater) so `totalCount` and paging stay aligned with the UI |
| **Native Menu Bar** | Full menu bar (app, File, Edit, Scan, View, Playback, Data, Tools, Window, Help). Top-level and item labels use `menu.*` / `tray.*` in SQLite `app_i18n`; `refresh_native_menu` rebuilds the bar after `reloadAppStrings` at startup (saved `uiLocale`) |
| **ETA Timers** | Estimated time remaining on plugin scans and update checks. Elapsed time on audio, DAW, and preset scans |
| **Trello Drag & Drop** | Unified Trello-style drag and drop everywhere: tabs, settings sections, audio player sections, table columns (audio/DAW/preset/MIDI/PDF), header stats, stats bars, favorites list, recently played queue, file browser bookmarks, tag cards, note cards, plugin cards, color presets. Floating ghost clone + dashed placeholder. All orders persisted. Column-drag uses `mousedown` tracking **without** `preventDefault()` so delegated header `click` handlers (sort by column) still run in WKWebView |
| **Draggable/Resizable Modals** | All modal windows (dashboard, dep graph, ALS viewer, duplicate report, similarity, export/import) are draggable via header and resizable from 8 edges/corners. Position/size persisted to prefs per modal |
| **FD Limit Control** | Configurable file descriptor limit (256-65536) in Settings → Performance. Raised via setrlimit at startup. Prevents scan aborts on large libraries or network shares |
| **Table page size** | Settings → Performance: one **Table Page Size** slider (default **200**, range 100–2000) applies to Samples, DAW, Presets, Plugins, MIDI, and PDF |
| **Cyberpunk Visualizer** | Animated equalizer bars in the floating player with cyan-to-magenta gradient. Bars bounce when playing, freeze on pause. Border glow pulse effect |
| **PDF Export** | Export any tab to PDF (A4 landscape, auto-sized columns proportional to content, 7pt font for maximum data density, background export with toast notification) |
| **TOML Export/Import** | Export/import all tabs in TOML format alongside JSON, CSV, TSV |
| **BPM Estimation** | Estimates tempo for all audio formats (WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC, OPUS) using symphonia decoder + onset-strength autocorrelation. Compressed formats decoded to PCM (30s max). Shown in metadata panel and table column. Cached to prefs across reboots. Background batch analysis starts as samples arrive |
| **LUFS Loudness** | Integrated loudness measurement (dBFS) per sample. Shown in metadata panel, table column (orange), and player meta line. Background analysis alongside BPM/Key. 8 tests: silence floor, sine wave levels, 6dB amplitude relationship, short files |
| **Visualizer Tab** | 6 real-time audio displays in 3×2 grid or single mode: FFT spectrum (log/linear), oscilloscope waveform (color picker), scrolling spectrogram (speed control), true stereo Lissajous (ChannelSplitter + dual AnalyserNodes), peak/RMS level meters (hold indicator), 10-band octave analyzer. **UI:** chamfered HUD panels, neon toolbar chips, canvas HUD grid + rounded-top spectrum/band bars, phosphor-style stereo field, glowing waveform stroke. 30fps throttle, pre-allocated buffers, zero CPU when tab hidden. Fullscreen mode (Escape to exit). Trello drag tiles. Context menus for per-tile params. Tile canvases cache `CanvasRenderingContext2D` references; log-scale FFT draws at most 1024 columns; spectrogram rendering steps frequency bins (≈256 vertical bands max) to cut fill calls |
| **Audio Engine tab** | **Sidecar** `audio-engine` (**JUCE** 8 — device I/O, file decode, **VST3 + AU** plugin scan via `KnownPluginList`; same stdin/stdout JSON IPC; **main** runs a **JUCE message loop** so **`playback_open_insert_editor`** can show native plug-in UIs): **engine_state**, **list_output_devices** / **list_input_devices**, **list_audio_device_types** / **set_audio_device_type**, **get_input_device_info** / **get_output_device_info**, **set_input_device** / **set_output_device**, **start_output_stream** / **stop_output_stream** (optional **`sample_rate_hz`**, optional **`start_playback`** after **`playback_load`** for library PCM + 3‑band EQ / gain / pan + optional **`playback_set_inserts`** VST3/AU chain). **`plugin_chain`** while scanning reports **`scan_done` / `scan_total` / `scan_skipped`** plus current format/name; **known-plugin-list.xml** in app data caches the last scan so unchanged modules are skipped faster. **Playback EQ UI** uses the same parametric canvas + **`playback_status`** spectrum overlay as the floating player (`#aeEqCanvas` shares one draw loop with `#npEqCanvas` in `audio.js`; sidecar DSP uses fixed low/mid/high shelving/peaking points — **dragging nodes on the canvas updates gain in prefs** for `playback_set_dsp`; frequency is the visualization only). **EQ canvas** height is resizable (80–480px, `aeEqCanvasHeight`). **`playback_open_insert_editor`** / **`playback_close_insert_editor`** (`slot` = chain index), **playback_*** status/seek/DSP, **`playback_set_inserts`**, **start_input_stream** / **stop_input_stream**, **set_output_tone** (F32 **440 Hz** test sine), **buffer_size** / **stream_buffer_frames**, **`plugin_chain`** (scan + active insert paths), **`waveform_preview`** / **`spectrogram_preview`** (offline min/max peaks + STFT dB grids; no device init). **F6** opens the tab. **Rust:** `audio_engine_invoke` (`src-tauri/src/audio_engine.rs`). **Dev:** `node scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs` (CMake + Ninja → `target/debug/audio-engine`). **Release:** `externalBin` + `scripts/prepare-audio-engine-sidecar.mjs`. **JS:** `frontend/js/audio-engine.js`. **Quit:** the host kills the sidecar by OS PID (`SIGKILL` / `taskkill /F`) before waiting on the IPC mutex, so quit cannot deadlock behind a thread blocked on `stdout.read_line`. **`AUDIO_HAXOR_PARENT_PID`** is set at spawn; the sidecar exits automatically if that PID disappears (covers force quit when Rust never runs cleanup). **`audio_engine_invoke`** uses **`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`** so long IPC does not stall the async runtime. **Restart sidecar** returns as soon as the OS kill is sent; **`Child`** reaping runs on a background thread so the success toast is not delayed by mutex cleanup. JUCE is **GPLv3 / commercial license** — see `audio-engine/README.md`. |
| **SQLite Backend** | All data stored in a single `audio_haxor.db` SQLite database (WAL mode, 64MB cache; extra read-only file handles round-robin under load—`[performance]` → `sqliteReadPoolExtra` in `preferences.toml` / Settings → Performance, `"auto"` or `0`–`32`, restart to apply; **`0` uses only the primary handle for reads**, so keep `"auto"` unless debugging). **Startup** runs DB housekeeping in two phases off the main thread: **light** (`PRAGMA optimize` + prewarm) after a short delay, then **heavy** (prune old scans, optional `VACUUM`, then `DB STATS` log) several seconds later, so first-frame `setup` / i18n never waits on long `DELETE` + `*_library` rebuild work on a shared pooled handle. Persists audio samples, plugins, DAW projects, presets, PDFs, MIDI files (FTS5-backed search; schema migration v13 backfills FTS5 shadow tables for pre-FTS or restored data so substring search still hits existing rows), per-domain scan history, KVR cache, waveform/spectrogram/xref/fingerprint caches, and app i18n. Inventory tables keep **one row per file per scan**; the Samples tab and paginated queries use the **library** (newest row per `path`). Schema migration v14 materializes that for audio as `audio_library(path PRIMARY KEY, sample_id)`; migration v15 adds `pdf_library`, `midi_library`, and `preset_library`; migration v16 adds `daw_library`; migration v17 normalizes stored plugin paths to the firmlink form (same `normalize_path_for_db` as inserts) and adds `plugin_library(path PRIMARY KEY, plugin_id)` with the same semantics (kept in sync on inserts and path-affecting deletes). The UI count can be lower than `COUNT(*)` on `audio_samples` when paths were rescanned. Settings → System Info shows both **raw table rows** and **library (unique paths)**. App preferences (`preferences.toml`) live in the same per-app data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor` on macOS); the backend never uses the process working directory as a fallback so launch method cannot “reset” prefs or DB paths. Designed for multi-million-row libraries without browser OOM: the UI loads samples, DAW projects, presets, PDFs, and MIDI from the DB in pages (bounded JS memory during scans). Sample search uses a standalone `COUNT(*)` plus `LIMIT` (no `COUNT(*) OVER()`), so the engine does not materialize the full match before paging; the samples toolbar’s per-format counts use a debounced second query so filtering stays responsive on very large libraries. While any paginated `db_query_*` runs (plugins, samples, DAW, presets, PDFs, MIDI), the tab’s search box shows a compact spinner (`setFilterFieldLoading` in `frontend/js/utils.js`, with inline placement so release WebViews do not rely on `:has()` for positioning) and the list or table shows a loading row; `yieldForFilterFieldPaint` (double `requestAnimationFrame` + `setTimeout(0)`) runs before `invoke` so release WKWebView actually paints the spinner; the spinner uses a dedicated `filter-field-spin` keyframe so rotation does not clobber `translateY(-50%)` centering. Overlapping requests are dropped by sequence so slower queries cannot overwrite a newer filter. All paginated library queries (`db_query_plugins`, `db_query_audio`, `db_query_daw`, `db_query_presets`, `db_query_pdfs`, `db_query_midi`) and their toolbar aggregate helpers (`db_*_filter_stats`) run SQLite on Tokio’s blocking pool. After each IPC round-trip, each tab yields (`setTimeout(0)`) before rebuilding list/table DOM so filter fields stay interactive during large `innerHTML` work. Per-cache clear buttons in Settings (BPM, Key, LUFS, Waveform, Spectrogram, Xref, Fingerprint, KVR) |
| **Tab switching** | Tab strip buttons are cached (like `_tabPanels`) and refreshed when tab order is saved, restored, or reset — `switchTab` no longer runs `querySelectorAll('.tab-btn')` every time. The global tag bar (`renderGlobalTagBar` in `notes.js`) skips rebuilding when the tag list, active tag, and visibility pref are unchanged; after a tab switch it is scheduled with `requestAnimationFrame` then `requestIdleCallback` (or `setTimeout(0)`) so work can run after paint. `switchTab` still runs heavy per-tab setup after **two** `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks so the tab strip and active panel can paint; it then **`yieldToBrowser` (macrotask)** before History IPC / Favorites / Notes / Settings so a quick tab switch does not stack per-tab work from an outdated switch after async gaps. Per-tab work checks `prefs.activeTab` matches the scheduled tab; leaving the **Visualizer** tab calls `stopVisualizer()` so the FFT loop stops immediately. **History** `fetchHistoryListsAndRender` yields once after the six IPC calls return and **before** merging/sorting scan rows on the main thread. Revisiting **History** repaints the last merged scan list immediately, then refreshes all six scan lists in the background without the global progress overlay (first visit or `loadHistory()` after a mutation still uses the overlay). Revisiting **Files** skips `listDirectory` IPC when the browser was already initialized for the current path (listing stays in the DOM while the tab is hidden); navigating, opening a favorite, or any action that calls `loadDirectory` still refreshes from disk. On cold start, the first paginated SQLite fetch for Samples, DAW, Presets, and PDF runs in parallel (`Promise.all` in `app.js`); each tab keeps its own monotonic query sequence so overlapping results still drop stale responses |
| **Walker Status Tab** | Tab bar between Visualizer and Audio Engine (**F5**). 4-tile live view of scanner threads: Plugin (cyan), Audio (yellow), DAW (magenta), Preset (orange). Shows thread count, dirs in buffer, full directory paths. Polls 500ms, auto-start/stop on tab switch. Right-click to copy paths |
| **Parametric EQ** | Visual frequency response curve with draggable band nodes (Low/Mid/High). Real-time FFT spectrum overlay at 60fps via Web Audio **AnalyserNode** when the `<audio>` graph is active, or via **`playback_status.spectrum`** when library playback runs through the **audio-engine** sidecar. Log frequency axis (20Hz–20kHz), drag to change frequency and gain on the Web Audio nodes; **EQ gain** is pushed to the sidecar during drag (`playback_set_dsp`). Sidecar audio uses fixed band frequencies (see Audio Engine tab row) |
| **Audio Similarity Search** | Right-click any sample → "Find Similar" to find samples that sound alike. Non-blocking floating panel (docked bottom-left, draggable, resizable, minimizable). Spectral fingerprinting: RMS energy, spectral centroid (normalized), zero-crossing rate, 3-band energy split, attack time. Parallel computation via rayon. Click results to play. Shortcut: W key |
| **Musical Key Detection** | Detects musical key (C Major, F# Minor, etc.) via Goertzel algorithm chromagram analysis across 7 octaves. Krumhansl-Kessler major/minor profile matching via Pearson correlation. Shown in metadata panel and player meta line alongside BPM. Cached per file. Supports all audio formats |
| **Heatmap Dashboard** | Full-screen analytics modal (95vw×95vh) with 8 cards: format distribution, size histogram, top folders, BPM histogram, key distribution (major cyan/minor magenta), activity timeline (last 24 months), plugin types, DAW formats. The modal opens immediately with a loading line; **overview counts** (samples, plugins, DAW projects, presets, total sample bytes) load via parallel **`db_*_filter_stats`** IPC calls and then cards render (previously those calls ran before the modal existed, so the button felt stuck). The dashboard button uses **`ipc.js` delegated `data-action` only** (no second listener) so a single click does not stack two overlays; rendering is **scoped to the active modal root** so duplicate `id`s cannot paint graphs into a hidden layer while a blank shell stays on top. Format / plugin-type / DAW breakdown cards use the same aggregates; size, folder, and timeline charts still reflect **loaded sample rows** only (hint when the page is a subset). Access via header button, D key, or right-click header |
| **Smart Playlists** | Rule-based auto-playlists with 10 rule types: format, BPM range, tag, favorite, recently played, name/path contains, min/max size, musical key. AND/OR match modes. Visual editor with live preview. 6 built-in presets. Context menu to add preset templates. Persisted to prefs |
| **Real FFT Spectrogram** | True frequency-domain spectrogram in metadata panel using Cooley-Tukey radix-2 FFT with Hann window, precomputed twiddle factors, log-frequency display mapping. Cyan→magenta color map. Spans same width as waveform |
| **File Browser Metadata** | Click any audio file to expand full metadata panel: format, size, sample rate, bit depth, channels, duration, byte rate, BPM, key, created/modified dates, permissions, path, favorite status, tags, notes. Full-width waveform background with playback cursor on each audio row |
| **Full Vim Keybindings** | j/k move, gg top, G bottom, Ctrl+D/U half-page, / search, o reveal, y yank path, p play, x favorite, v select, V select-all, w find-similar, e expand player, q EQ, u mono, d dashboard, b A-B loop. 49 total customizable keybindings |
| **Command Palette** | Press <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> to open a fuzzy search across tabs, actions, bookmarked directories, and tags. The large tab/action/toggle list is **built once per locale** (cached; cleared when UI strings reload). On each **open**, bookmarks, tags, and player-related rows are merged once into a session list (not rebuilt every keystroke). Row type badges are resolved once per session; arrow keys move selection by toggling a CSS class (no full list repaint). For queries of **2+ characters**, in-memory matches render immediately, SQLite inventory hits merge in afterward via **`db_query_palette_preview`** (one IPC round-trip; local rows keep their first fuzzy scores — no duplicate pass). Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, Escape to dismiss. Uses the same fzf scoring engine as tab search bars |
| **Directory Bookmarks** | Bookmark favorite directories in the File Browser for instant navigation. Chips displayed above the file list, persisted across sessions. Right-click any folder to bookmark it |
| **Quick Nav Buttons** | File browser toolbar has Desktop, Downloads, Music, Documents, and Root (/) buttons for instant navigation. Large listings append in chunks (`FILE_LIST_CHUNK` in `file-browser.js`) with `yieldToBrowser` between chunks; filter input uses **150ms** debounce (`debounceMs` on `filterFiles`) |
| **Splash Screen** | Cyberpunk boot sequence with animated gradient title sweep, progress bar, version display. Fades out after init before data loads |
| **Cyberpunk Animations** | 30 CSS animations: neon focus pulse, button hover glow, modal zoom-in, context menu scale, format badge shimmer, toast glow pulse, neon gradient scrollbars, tactile depth shadows on every interactive element |
| **System Info** | Real-time display in 7 sections: System (OS, arch, hostname, CPU, disk), Process (PID, version, memory, threads, FD limits, uptime), Thread Pools (rayon, per-scanner, channel buffers), Scanner State (live dots), Scan Results (counts), Database (SQLite size, per-table row counts), Storage (data dir) |
| **App Info** | Architecture and feature reference: build details (version, Tauri version, target, profile), supported formats (10 audio, 5 plugin, 13 DAW, 14 preset), plugin extraction (12 DAW formats), analysis engines (BPM, Key, LUFS, Fingerprint), visualizers (6 types), export formats (5 types), storage backend, UI framework, search engine |
| **fzf Tuning** | 8 configurable fuzzy search parameters (match score, gap penalties, boundary/camelCase/consecutive bonuses) in Settings → Fuzzy Search with live preview and reset to defaults |
| **Scan preserves visible rows** | During a scan, streamed progress updates counts and the scan button only; **inventory tables are not written from stream batches** when they already have SQLite-backed rows (so batch selection and the current page stay). Streamed row appends run **only** when the table body was empty before the scan (first-time empty library). Post-scan reload still comes from `db_query_*` / `fetch*Page` as before |
| **Filter Persistence** | All 6 filter dropdowns (plugin type, status, favorite type, audio format, DAW, preset format) saved to prefs and restored on startup. Multi-select values preserved. While a domain scan is running, tab search/sort still use the same `db_query_*` library queries (rows are committed incrementally); after you change a filter, streaming DOM append for that tab pauses so the grid stays SQLite-backed until the scan finishes |
| **Plugin Name Normalization** | Cross-reference matching normalizes plugin names: strips arch suffixes (x64, ARM64, Stereo), case-folds, collapses whitespace. "Serum", "SERUM (x64)", "serum" all match |
| **macOS Firmlink Dedup** | Scanners normalize `/System/Volumes/Data` paths to avoid duplicate traversal; the SQLite layer applies the same prefix strip when persisting path columns, scan roots, plugin directories, incremental `directory_scan_state`, analysis updates, and path-keyed caches so stored strings stay shorter and consistent |
| **Incremental unified scan** | Stores each visited directory’s mtime in SQLite (`directory_scan_state`); on the next unified scan, subtrees whose directory mtime is unchanged are skipped (faster on large trees and network shares) **only when** the last unified run finished with outcome `complete` (see `unified_scan_run` in [`incremental-scan.md`](incremental-scan.md)). Preference `incrementalDirectoryScan` (`on`/`off`, default `on` in `config.default.toml`). **Plugin-only** scans always `read_dir` each VST/AU root (they do not reuse this map — reusing it would skip roots after a prior unified walk or a prior plugin scan and show zero plugins) |
| **Scanner skip dirs** | Shared `scanner_skip_dirs::SCANNER_SKIP_DIRS` skips dependency trees (npm, Bower, JSPM, CocoaPods, Carthage, Composer, etc.), build output (`target`, `build`, `dist`, `out`, CMake `cmake-build-*`, MSVC-style `Debug`/`Release`/`RelWithDebInfo`/`MinSizeRel`, `x64`/`x86`, Bazel `bazel-*`, Buck `buck-out`, Zig `zig-*`, Mix `_build`, Nim `nimbledeps`/`nimcache`, `DerivedData`), .NET (`obj`, NuGet `packages`), Python envs (`venv`, `site-packages`, `__pycache__`, …), test/coverage exports (`coverage`, `htmlcov`, `lcov-report`, `storybook-static`, …), caches, OS metadata (`lost+found`), and Time Machine / Synology dirs; hidden (`.`) and Synology `@` directories are skipped at traversal |
| **Browse Button** | Native folder picker on each Scan Directories row (plugins, samples, DAW, presets, MIDI, PDF) to grant macOS TCC permissions for mounted volumes |
| **Error Logging** | Global JS error handler logs uncaught errors and unhandled rejections to `app.log` in the data directory; the **audio-engine** sidecar writes **`ENGINE:`** lines to **`engine.log`**. Export/clear via Settings → Files &amp; Export. **App log verbosity** (`[logging]` → `verbosity` in `preferences.toml`, default `normal`): **Normal** — scan lifecycle, errors, TCC/readdir failures, incremental warnings, `APP START`/`CONFIG`; **Verbose** — those plus SMB dedup/enter/retry/recovered, MIDI mount/dedup, `UPDATE VERBOSE — KVR network fetch` before each uncached KVR hit, incremental snapshot key count, unified walker entry counts at depth 0–2; **Quiet** — optional prefix filter on normal-level lines (empty by default). Startup `CONFIG` includes `log_verbosity` |
| **Sortable Analysis Columns** | BPM, Key, Duration, Channels, LUFS columns in sample table are all clickable to sort ascending/descending. All column headers have tooltips |
| **Settings Export** | Export all preferences and keyboard shortcuts to a text file. Export app error log for debugging. Clear log button |
| **Sample Table Columns** | 12 columns: checkbox, Name, Format, Size, BPM, Key, Duration, Channels, LUFS, Modified, Path, Actions. All sortable, all with tooltips. BPM/Key/LUFS from background analysis, Duration/Channels from scan headers. All columns draggable to reorder. **Samples filter** uses **400ms** debounce (`filterAudioSamples` in `audio.js`); **1–2 characters** hit the DB with `LIKE`, **three or more** use FTS5 `MATCH` (`fts_phrase` in `db.rs`, trigram tokenizer needs ≥3 chars) — so the first query after typing a third character does more work than short-prefix `LIKE`; that is expected, not a broken FTS |
| **Paginated History** | Merged timeline sidebar appends in chunks (`HISTORY_SIDEBAR_CHUNK` in `history.js`) with `yieldToBrowser` between chunks. Scan detail views render in batches of 200 with scroll-to-load-more |
| **Scan Button Mobility** | Scan All/Stop/Resume button group draggable between header, stats bar, and tab nav. Dashboard button same. Position persisted |
| **Cache Manager** | Settings → Database Caches: cache stats table first, then BPM/Key/LUFS title and description, then **Run analysis** / **Stop analysis** (left-aligned under that text; background batch; stop completes after the current batch). Per-row **Clear** on the table, plus **Clear All Caches** / **Clear All Databases** / **Refresh**. **Clear All Databases** wipes scan-history tables only; strings `ui.btn.clear_all_databases`, `ui.tt.clear_all_databases`, `confirm.clear_all_scan_databases`, `toast.all_scan_databases_cleared`, and `menu.clear_all_databases` (Data menu + command palette). All caches stored in SQLite |
| **Background Analysis** | Sequential BPM/Key/LUFS/metadata analysis starts as samples arrive during scan. Auto-pauses on user interaction, 50ms yield, saves every 50 samples. Cached to SQLite across reboots. Progress badge in header |
| **Neon Glow Animations** | Animated pulsing neon borders on all modals, panels, walker tiles, visualizer tiles, heatmap cards, context menus, and command palette. Staggered delays create wave effects. Toggle on/off in Settings → Appearance |
| **Resizable Recent List** | Audio player recently played list is vertically resizable via CSS resize handle (min 80px) |
| **Folder Watch / Auto-Scan** | Watch configured scan directories for new/changed files using native filesystem events (FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows). 2-second debounce batches rapid changes. Classifies paths by extension (audio, DAW project, preset, plugin, PDF, MIDI). Emits **per-category scan roots** (parent folder of each changed file, or the bundle dir for `.vst3`/`.logicx`/etc.); redundant nested roots are collapsed. Each affected scanner runs **only those subtrees** — not a full library scan. Toggle in Settings → Scanning. Auto-starts on launch if enabled |
| **Cross-Platform** | Fully portable across macOS, Linux, and Windows. Process stats (RSS, CPU, threads, disk) via sysinfo crate on all platforms. File watcher uses native OS events. Scanner directories auto-detected per OS. All SQLite, audio analysis, and UI code is platform-agnostic |

## // QUICK START //

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/Audio-Haxor.git
cd Audio-Haxor

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for distribution
pnpm tauri build
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), and **CMake + Ninja** (the **`audio-engine`** sidecar is **C++/JUCE**, built by `scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs` before dev and by `scripts/prepare-audio-engine-sidecar.mjs` before release). On Linux, install ALSA/X11 dev packages as listed in `audio-engine/README.md`. The Tauri CLI is pulled in as a dev dependency.

---

## // DEV vs BUILD — IMPORTANT //

**Dev (`pnpm tauri dev`) and Build (`pnpm tauri build`) behave differently.** Always verify in the build before shipping.

### Differences

**Library playback (`start_playback`):** **`playback_load`** uses **JUCE** `AudioFormatReader` (supported formats per `AudioFormatManager::registerBasicFormats`). **`start_output_stream`** with **`start_playback: true`** opens **`AudioDeviceManager`** + **`AudioTransportSource`** + **`AudioSourcePlayer`** on the selected device. **`buffer_frames`** is **capped at 8192** in the sidecar (and in **`audio-engine.js`** prefs). After **Stop stream**, **Apply** runs **`playback_load`** from the last engine preview path so **`start_playback`** works again. **`playback_set_dsp`** (gain/pan/EQ) applies in the sidecar **DSP** stage. **`playback_set_speed`** (0.25–2×) drives **`juce::ResamplingAudioSource`** on the file reader (tape-style pitch follows speed; **reverse** path stays 1×). **Reverse** uses a RAM-heavy full-file decode path (same tradeoff as the previous rodio path). **`playback_status`** includes **`spectrum`** (1024 uint8 magnitudes from a real FFT of the post-insert mono tap) so the WebView FFT strip and parametric EQ fills track engine output without **`AnalyserNode`**. See `audio-engine/README.md`.

| | Dev | Build |
|---|---|---|
| Audio engine sidecar | Host resolves `target/debug` or `target/release` by walking up from `current_exe()` (covers macOS dev bundles where the sibling `audio-engine` can be stale). Optional override: `AUDIO_HAXOR_AUDIO_ENGINE` (absolute path). | Bundled next to the app binary (`externalBin`) |
| URL scheme | `http://localhost` | `tauri://localhost` |
| CSP | Relaxed | Strict (no inline JS) |
| Frontend | Served from disk (live) | Embedded in binary |
| WebView cache | None (dev server) | Aggressive (survives app restart) |
| CSS layout | Standard web | Slightly different height inheritance |
| Canvas | `clientWidth` stable | `clientWidth` can fluctuate |

### Rules

1. **Never use inline `onclick`/`onchange`** — blocked by CSP in build. Always use `addEventListener` in JS files.
2. **Never set `canvas.width`/`canvas.height` in a render loop** — causes infinite resize loops in build. Set once, or use fixed HTML attributes with CSS `width:100%;height:100%`.
3. **Never rely on `height: 100%` cascading** — use explicit pixel values.
4. **Guard cross-file function calls** with `typeof fn === 'function'` — script load order differs.
5. **Don't use CSS classes on dynamically created elements** if the class has layout-affecting styles — use inline styles or dedicated CSS classes that only set visual properties.
6. **Never use `box-shadow`, `animation`, `transition`, `background-image` (gradient), `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements, or `position: relative` on elements inside CSS `columns:` (multicol) layout** — WebKit's release renderer creates GPU compositing layers that corrupt child text, bar charts, and dynamic content (flicker, wrong sizes, black regions). Only plain `border`, `background-color`, and `padding` are safe there. **Settings** uses **CSS multicol** (`columns: 1/2/3/4` at responsive breakpoints) with `column-fill: balance` for equal-height columns and `break-inside: avoid` on sections. Sections are ordered to distribute tall panes (Color Scheme, Scan Directories, Performance, Keyboard Shortcuts) across different columns. Disables `.settings-heading` text glow and `.settings-row` border-glow **animation** inside `.settings-container` to keep System/App Info panes and neighbors stable in the WebView.
7. **Defer percentage-based widths on flex children inside modals** — `width:X%` on flex children (bar charts, progress bars) renders at wrong values on first paint because the flex container width isn't resolved yet. Set `width:0` initially, store the target in `data-bar-pct`, then apply via `requestAnimationFrame` after the modal is visible.

### Cache Busting

Build looks different from dev? Clear **all 4** WebView cache directories:

```bash
find ~/Library/WebKit/audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/WebKit/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/Caches/audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/Caches/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     -delete 2>/dev/null
```

Also bump the `?v=XXX` query strings on all `<script>` tags in `index.html` to bust compiled JS bytecode cache.

### Build Commands

```bash
# Normal build (~14s)
pnpm tauri build

# Clean build (when frontend changes aren't picked up, ~40s)
cargo clean --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --release && pnpm tauri build

# Nuclear option: clear caches + clean build
find ~/Library/WebKit/audio-haxor ~/Library/WebKit/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     ~/Library/Caches/audio-haxor ~/Library/Caches/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor \
     -delete 2>/dev/null
cargo clean --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --release && pnpm tauri build
```

**Rust compile errors**

- **`couldn't read ... i18n/app_i18n_*.json`** — `src-tauri/src/app_i18n.rs` embeds every shipped locale at compile time (`include_str!`). Pull latest `main` so all `i18n/app_i18n_*.json` files are present; do not delete locale files locally.
- **`Cannot find module ... prepare-audio-engine-sidecar.mjs`** — Tauri runs `beforeBuildCommand` with **cwd = repository root** (same as `pnpm tauri build`). The command must be `node scripts/prepare-audio-engine-sidecar.mjs`, not `node ../scripts/...` (that resolves outside the repo).
- **`failed to build archive` / `failed to open object file` (.rlib)** — corrupted or partial Cargo output (often after an interrupted build). With a **workspace** `Cargo.toml` at the repo root, artifacts live in **`target/`** at the root as well as under `src-tauri/`. Remove and rebuild: `command rm -rf target src-tauri/target` then `pnpm tauri build` (or `pnpm nuke`).

### Data Location

All data persists at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.menketechnologies.audio-haxor/
  audio_haxor.db        -- SQLite database (all scans, caches, history)
  preferences.toml      -- User preferences (human-readable config)
  app.log               -- Application error log (Rust/JS)
  engine.log            -- Audio-engine sidecar log (JUCE `ENGINE:` lines; optional crash backtraces)
```
This directory survives app reinstalls. Never deleted by builds.

### NPM Scripts

```bash
pnpm run clean      # Remove src-tauri/target, dist, node_modules/.cache
pnpm run rebuild    # Clean + full release build
pnpm test           # JS + Rust tests
pnpm run doc        # Rust API docs → src-tauri/target/doc/
pnpm run doc:open   # Same + open app_lib docs in browser
pnpm run doc:sync   # Regenerate rustdoc and copy to docs/api/ + use docs/index.html
```

---

## // TESTING //

```bash
pnpm test
cd src-tauri && cargo test
pnpm run test:js
```

---

## // API DOCUMENTATION (RUST — HTML) //

Rust API docs (rustdoc) are generated for the `app_lib` crate:

```bash
# Generate HTML under src-tauri/target/doc/ (opens in browser)
pnpm doc:open

# Regenerate and copy a browsable tree into docs/api/ (for GitHub Pages or offline)
pnpm doc:sync
```

After `pnpm doc:sync`, open `docs/index.html` in a browser, or open `docs/api/app_lib/index.html` directly. The canonical build output is always `src-tauri/target/doc/app_lib/index.html`.

## // HOW IT WORKS //

```
[1] SCAN -----> Rust backend crawls platform-specific plugin directories
                (VST2, VST3, AU, CLAP). Streams results to the WebView via
                Tauri events in batches of 10. Collects name, type, version,
                manufacturer, website, size, and mod date.

[2] AUDIO ----> Separate scanner discovers audio samples (WAV, FLAC, AIFF,
                MP3, OGG) with metadata extraction. Inline playback via
                Tauri's native asset:// protocol for zero-latency local
                file streaming.

[3] DAW ------> DAW scanner finds project files across 14+ DAW formats
                (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, REAPER, Cubase, Pro Tools,
                Bitwig, Studio One, Reason, Audacity, GarageBand, Ardour,
                dawproject). Tracks file sizes and modification dates.

[4] CHECK ----> Async Rust tasks search KVR Audio for each plugin's product
                page, scrape version info. Falls back to DuckDuckGo
                site:kvraudio.com search. Groups by manufacturer to reduce
                duplicate queries. Cards update in-place as results arrive.
                Status bar shows current plugin and live tallies.

[5] HISTORY --> Each scan is persisted to SQLite. Plugin, audio, DAW, preset,
                PDF, and MIDI scans are merged in the history timeline. Diff any
                two snapshots of the same type to see added/removed rows (plugins
                also show version changes). Last scan auto-restores on startup.

[6] EXPORT ---> Export any tab to JSON, TOML, CSV, TSV, or PDF via native
                file dialogs. Import from JSON or TOML.
```

---

## // KVR AUDIO RATE LIMITING //

This app queries [KVR Audio](https://www.kvraudio.com) to find plugin versions and
download links. To avoid overloading KVR's servers, strict rate limiting is enforced:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Concurrent requests | 1 (sequential) |
| Delay between plugins | 2 seconds |
| Delay between KVR page fetches | 1.5 seconds |
| Delay before DuckDuckGo fallback | 1.5 seconds |
| Max product pages checked per plugin | 2 |

The background KVR resolver (auto-runs on startup) also uses 2-second delays

## // PROJECT ARCHITECTURE //

```
Cargo.toml (repo root) -- Cargo workspace: member `src-tauri` (`audio-haxor` app). The **`audio-engine`** sidecar is a **C++/JUCE** CMake target (not a Cargo crate); `audio-engine/README.md` + `scripts/build-audio-engine.mjs` build it into `target/debug|release/audio-engine`. Shared `target/` at repo root. Locale JSON must use the **same `{placeholder}` names** as English for `appFmt`; `scripts/sync_i18n_placeholders_from_en.py` copies English strings for any key that drifts (run after bulk locale edits if `cargo test` seed tests fail).

audio-engine/
  README.md            -- Sidecar protocol + JUCE + CMake build notes
  CMakeLists.txt       -- JUCE FetchContent + `audio-engine` executable
  src/                 -- C++ stdin/stdout JSON IPC (`Engine.cpp`, `Main.cpp`)

src-tauri/
  src/
    main.rs            -- Tauri entry point
    lib.rs             -- IPC command handlers, export/import, file ops
    bpm.rs             -- BPM estimation via onset-strength autocorrelation
    scanner.rs         -- Plugin filesystem scanner (VST2/VST3/AU/CLAP)
    scanner_skip_dirs.rs -- Shared directory-name blocklist for all recursive scanners
    audio_scanner.rs   -- Audio sample discovery + metadata extraction
    daw_scanner.rs     -- DAW project scanner (14+ formats)
    preset_scanner.rs  -- Plugin preset discovery
    similarity.rs      -- Audio similarity search via spectral fingerprinting
    xref.rs            -- Plugin ↔ DAW cross-reference engine (11 DAW formats)
    db.rs              -- SQLite database layer (paginated queries, 6M+ sample scale)
    file_watcher.rs    -- Filesystem watcher for auto-scan; debounced `file-watcher-change` with per-category subtree roots
    history.rs         -- Scan history persistence + diff engine
    key_detect.rs      -- Musical key detection via Goertzel chromagram
    lufs.rs            -- LUFS loudness measurement
    midi.rs            -- MIDI file parsing and metadata
    kvr.rs             -- KVR Audio scraper + version checker
  Cargo.toml           -- App crate manifest (workspace member)
  tauri.conf.json      -- Tauri app configuration + CSP (`worker-src 'self' blob:` for `audio-decode-worker.js`) + bundling + `externalBin` for `binaries/audio-engine`

frontend/
  index.html           -- Cyberpunk CRT UI (HTML/CSS)
  js/
    app.js             -- Startup, auto-load last scan, restore preferences; `applyInventoryCounts` keeps header strip + stats-bar totals from SQLite (`get_active_scan_inventory_counts`: one row per path, library scope — not tied to a single `scan_id`); scans stream-insert per batch; `applyInventoryCountsPartial` throttles DB refresh on progress; `handleFileWatcherChange` runs targeted per-root rescans from `roots_by_category` (sequential `await` per category); **Scan All** `prepareUnifiedScan` then delayed `scanUnified`; **Stop All** uses `stopUnifiedScan` for the four inventory types
    audio.js           -- Audio sample scanning + inline playback + floating player; with **audio-engine** library playback, the `<audio>` element is muted and disconnected from Web Audio (no duplicate output through the WebView). DevTools **`console.warn('[audio-haxor] drawMetaPanelVisuals:…')`** when expanded-row worker decode falls back to main-thread waveform/spectrogram (includes `path`, `url`, `bars`, `error`)
    audio-decode-worker.js -- Web Worker decode; `createDecodeContext()` uses `self.OfflineAudioContext || self.webkitOfflineAudioContext` (WKWebView workers have no bare `OfflineAudioContext`), then `AudioContext` if needed
    batch-select.js    -- Checkbox selection + batch operations
    command-palette.js -- Cmd+K fuzzy search; static rows + session item list + type-label cache; arrow keys update selection class only; 2+ char DB merge uses `db_query_palette_preview` (SQLite); **Build fingerprint cache** loads paths from `db_audio_library_paths` (SQLite `audio_library`), same as Settings → cache fingerprint build
    columns.js         -- Resizable table columns with width persistence
    context-menu.js    -- Right-click context menus for all elements
    daw.js             -- DAW project scanning + stats; `fetchAllDawProjectsForXref` loads the full SQLite list for **Plugin Index** (paginated UI keeps `allDawProjects` to one page)
    disk-usage.js      -- Stacked bar charts for storage breakdown
    content_hash.rs    -- SHA-256 streaming hash for byte-identical duplicate groups
    duplicates.js      -- Duplicate modal: name heuristics + optional content (SHA-256) scan via `find_content_duplicates`
    export.js          -- Export/import (JSON/TOML/CSV/TSV/PDF); **format modal** opens immediately (counts from in-memory rows or DB totals); **full SQLite pull** runs after you choose format and save path when the paginated UI has not already loaded every row (plugins, presets, samples, DAW, MIDI, PDF)
    favorites.js       -- Favorites management
    file-browser.js    -- Filesystem navigation with tags + notes; breadcrumbs/parent/quick-nav/bookmark chip names use `normalizePathSeparators` + `pathFileName` / `parentDirectoryPath` for Windows paths from `fs_list_dir`; chunked row append + path→sample `Map` for duration badges; filter debounce 150ms
    help-overlay.js    -- Keyboard shortcuts reference overlay
    history.js         -- Scan history management + merged timeline
    ipc.js             -- Tauri v2 IPC bridge + event delegation; `stopAll` stops every scanner plus KVR update check (`stop_updates`); native menu actions use `typeof` guards; Tauri `listen` unlisteners use `.catch` so teardown never rejects
    keyboard-nav.js    -- Arrow key / j/k table row navigation
    kvr.js             -- KVR Audio resolver + cache management
    multi-filter.js    -- Multi-select checkbox dropdowns
    notes.js           -- Note editor + tag management + tag cloud
    plugins.js         -- Plugin scanning, filtering, sorting, updates; awaits `onScanProgress` (`listen('scan-progress')`) before `invoke('scan_plugins')` so streamed batches are not dropped
    presets.js         -- Preset scanning + filtering
    settings.js        -- Color schemes, themes, toggles, preferences
    shortcuts.js       -- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
    sort-persist.js    -- Sort column/direction persistence per tab
    utils.js           -- fzf search, escaping, slugs, formatting, `postScanCompleteToast` (scan-finished slide-ins; suppressed during Scan All), `fetchAudioLibraryPathsForFingerprint` (SQLite `audio_library` paths for fingerprint cache builds; falls back to in-memory list)
    xref.js            -- Plugin ↔ DAW cross-reference UI + project viewer (11 formats); **Plugin Index** shows an immediate toast + global progress while projects load and parse
    dep-graph.js       -- Plugin dependency graph visualization
    visualizer.js      -- 6 real-time audio displays (FFT, waveform, spectrogram, Lissajous, levels, bands)
    walker-status.js   -- 4-tile live scanner thread status view
    audio-engine.js    -- Audio Engine tab + `enginePlaybackStart` / `playback_*` for library output through the sidecar; mirrors floating-player parametric EQ (canvas + FFT), volume, speed, pan, and engine transport (play/pause, ±5s seek, reverse); tab layout matches **Settings** (`settings-container` / `settings-section` / `settings-row`)
    heatmap-dashboard.js -- 8-card analytics dashboard
    smart-playlists.js -- Rule-based auto-playlists (10 rule types)
    drag-reorder.js    -- Unified Trello-style drag/drop + table column reorder
    modal-drag.js      -- Modal drag/resize with geometry persistence
