# Reshape the bundled `audio-engine` sidecar (Tauri externalBin output) into a nested macOS
# helper .app inside the parent bundle's Contents/MacOS/, then re-sign the result.
#
# Without this reshape, the audio-engine runs as a bare Mach-O sibling of the main
# `audio-haxor` binary in Contents/MacOS/. macOS resolves [NSBundle mainBundle] for that
# process by walking up to the nearest enclosing .app, which lands on AUDIO_HAXOR.app —
# so the helper inherits the parent's bundle context. audiocomponentd then refuses (or
# silently stalls) the XPC view-controller delivery for AU plugins loaded out-of-process
# via _RemoteAUv2ViewFactory, leaving plugin editor windows blank (1×1 stub NSView).
#
# After this script:
#   AUDIO_HAXOR.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioHaxorEngineHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/audio-engine
#   AUDIO_HAXOR.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioHaxorEngineHelper.app/Contents/Info.plist
#
# [NSBundle mainBundle] from the helper now resolves to AudioHaxorEngineHelper.app (its own
# bundle ID, its own Info.plist, distinct from the parent), and audiocomponentd accepts the
# helper as a real Cocoa host. The Rust resolver in src-tauri/src/audio_engine.rs looks for
# the helper at this path before falling back to the legacy sibling-in-Contents/MacOS/ layout.
#
# Codesigning ordering matters: sign innermost first, work outward. The outer .app's
# CodeResources includes a hash of the inner .app's signature, so the inner .app must be
# fully signed before the outer .app re-signs. Re-signing the outer must NOT use --deep
# (which would recursively re-sign and overwrite the inner signatures we just made).

# That means we MUST pass --options runtime and --entitlements here, or the inner binary
# will end up with `flags=0x2(adhoc)` only — without the runtime flag, hardened runtime
# is OFF and the entitlements are inert (Apple ignores entitlements on non-runtime binaries).
#
# The plugin host entitlements (com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation,
# allow-jit, allow-unsigned-executable-memory, disable-executable-page-protection) are
# required for the helper to dlopen 3rd-party VST3/AU bundles signed by other Team IDs
# and for JIT-using plugins (Serum 2 wavetables, etc.) to allocate executable memory.

# `audio-haxor` binary's existing signature is still valid (we never touched it).
#
# NOT --deep — that would recursively re-sign the inner helper .app we just signed in
# step 1, dropping the runtime flag again (codesign on a bundle without --options
# runtime always strips runtime even with --force). This is a JUCE-host classic that
# bites every plugin host that ships nested helper bundles.
#
# We DO pass --options runtime + --entitlements to be consistent with how Tauri signed
